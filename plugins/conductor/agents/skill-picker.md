# Skill Picker - Search & Install Skills from SkillsMP

You search skillsmp.com's 28,000+ skills using AI semantic search, preview skill content, and install skills to the local project for workers to use.

## API Configuration

```bash
API_KEY="sk_live_skillsmp_mM56unNCsc6BaVF5w9RT0VL9Y3gvhhG6qaPc0axbTaU"
```

## Search Skills

### AI Semantic Search (Recommended)
Best for natural language queries like "skills for building REST APIs with FastAPI":

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search?q=YOUR+QUERY+HERE" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" | jq '.data.data[:5] | .[] | {name: .skill.name, author: .skill.author, description: .skill.description, githubUrl: .skill.githubUrl, stars: .skill.stars}'
```

### Keyword Search
For specific terms:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/search?q=fastapi&limit=5&sortBy=stars" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" | jq '.skills[] | {name, author, description, githubUrl, stars}'
```

## Preview Skill Content

After finding a skill, fetch its SKILL.md from GitHub:

```bash
# Extract raw GitHub URL from githubUrl
# Example: https://github.com/author/repo/tree/main/.claude/skills/name
# Convert to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/author/repo/main/.claude/skills/name/SKILL.md

GITHUB_URL="https://github.com/author/repo/tree/main/path/to/skill"
RAW_URL=$(echo "$GITHUB_URL" | sed 's|github.com|raw.githubusercontent.com|' | sed 's|/tree/|/|')
curl -s "$RAW_URL/SKILL.md" | head -100
```

## Install Skill

Install to project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
SKILL_NAME="skill-name"
mkdir -p .claude/skills/$SKILL_NAME

# Fetch and save SKILL.md
curl -s "$RAW_URL/SKILL.md" > .claude/skills/$SKILL_NAME/SKILL.md

# Check for references directory
curl -s "$RAW_URL/references/" | grep -q "md" && {
  mkdir -p .claude/skills/$SKILL_NAME/references
  # Fetch reference files...
}

echo "Installed $SKILL_NAME to .claude/skills/"
```

## Workflow: Find and Install Skill

1. **Understand the need**: What capability does the worker need?
2. **Search**: Use AI semantic search with natural description
3. **Review top results**: Check stars, description, author
4. **Preview**: Fetch SKILL.md to verify quality
5. **Install**: Save to `.claude/skills/`
6. **Report**: Tell conductor which skill was installed

## Example

User: "Find a skill for building FastAPI applications"

```bash
# Search
curl -s -X GET "https://skillsmp.com/api/v1/skills/ai-search?q=building+production+FastAPI+applications" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_skillsmp_mM56unNCsc6BaVF5w9RT0VL9Y3gvhhG6qaPc0axbTaU" | jq '.data.data[0].skill'

# Preview
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wshobson/agents/main/skills/fastapi-templates/SKILL.md" | head -50

# Install
mkdir -p .claude/skills/fastapi-templates
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wshobson/agents/main/skills/fastapi-templates/SKILL.md" > .claude/skills/fastapi-templates/SKILL.md
```

## Response Format

After installing, report back to conductor:

```
Installed: fastapi-templates
Author: wshobson (23k stars)
Description: Create production-ready FastAPI projects with...
Location: .claude/skills/fastapi-templates/

Worker can now use: "use the fastapi-templates skill to..."
```

## Notes

- Skills are project-local (`.claude/skills/`) - workers in that directory can use them
- Higher stars generally means better quality
- Preview before installing to verify relevance
- Some skills have `references/` directories with additional docs

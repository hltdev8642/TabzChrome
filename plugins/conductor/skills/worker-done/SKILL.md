# Worker Done - Task Completion Orchestrator

Orchestrates the full task completion pipeline by composing atomic commands.

## Usage

```bash
/conductor:worker-done TabzChrome-abc

# Or if issue ID is in your task header:
/conductor:worker-done
```

## Pipeline Overview

| Step | Command | Blocking? | Skip if DOCS_ONLY? |
|------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0 | Detect change types | No | - |
| 1 | `/conductor:verify-build` | Yes - stop on failure | Yes |
| 2 | `/conductor:run-tests` | Yes - stop on failure | Yes |
| 3 | `/conductor:code-review` | Yes - stop on failure | Yes |
| 4 | `/conductor:commit-changes` | Yes - stop on failure | No |
| 5 | `/conductor:create-followups` | No - log and continue | No |
| 6 | `/conductor:update-docs` | No - log and continue | No |
| 7 | `/conductor:close-issue` | Yes - report result | No |
| 8 | Notify conductor | No - best effort | No |

**CRITICAL: You MUST execute Step 8 after Step 7.** Workers that skip Step 8 force the conductor to poll, wasting resources.

**DOCS_ONLY mode:** When all changes are markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`), steps 1-3 are skipped. This saves time and API calls for documentation-only changes.

---

## Execute Pipeline

### Step 0: Detect Change Types
```bash
echo "=== Step 0: Detecting Change Types ==="
# Check if only markdown files changed (staged + unstaged)
git diff --cached --name-only
git diff --name-only
```

**Detection logic:**
1. Get list of all changed files (staged and unstaged)
2. Check if ALL changes are markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`)
3. Set `DOCS_ONLY=true` if only markdown, otherwise `DOCS_ONLY=false`

```bash
# Detection check - if ANY file is non-markdown, run full pipeline
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -qvE '\.(md|markdown)$' 2>/dev/null; then
  DOCS_ONLY=false
elif git diff --name-only | grep -qvE '\.(md|markdown)$' 2>/dev/null; then
  DOCS_ONLY=false
else
  # Check if there are actually any changes at all
  if [ -z "$(git diff --cached --name-only)$(git diff --name-only)" ]; then
    DOCS_ONLY=false  # No changes = run normal pipeline
  else
    DOCS_ONLY=true
  fi
fi
```

If `DOCS_ONLY=true`: Skip to **Step 4** (skip build, tests, and review).
If `DOCS_ONLY=false`: Continue with full pipeline.

---

### Step 1: Verify Build (skip if DOCS_ONLY)
```bash
echo "=== Step 1: Build Verification ==="
```
Run `/conductor:verify-build`. If `passed: false` -> **STOP**, fix errors, re-run.

### Step 2: Run Tests (skip if DOCS_ONLY)
```bash
echo "=== Step 2: Test Verification ==="
```
Run `/conductor:run-tests`. If `passed: false` -> **STOP**, fix tests, re-run.

### Step 3: Code Review (skip if DOCS_ONLY)
```bash
echo "=== Step 3: Code Review ==="
```
Run `/conductor:code-review` (spawns code-reviewer subagent). If `passed: false` -> **STOP**, fix blockers, re-run.

### Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
echo "=== Step 4: Commit ==="
```
Run `/conductor:commit-changes <issue-id>`. Creates conventional commit with Claude signature.

### Step 5-6: Non-blocking
```bash
echo "=== Step 5: Follow-up Tasks ==="
echo "=== Step 6: Documentation Check ==="
```
Run `/conductor:create-followups` and `/conductor:update-docs`. Log and continue.

### Step 7: Close Issue
```bash
echo "=== Step 7: Close Issue ==="
```
Run `/conductor:close-issue <issue-id>`. Reports final status.

### Step 8: Notify Conductor (REQUIRED)

**DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP.** After closing the issue, notify the conductor:

```bash
echo "=== Step 8: Notify Conductor ==="

# Get conductor session from environment (set when worker was spawned)
CONDUCTOR_SESSION="${CONDUCTOR_SESSION:-}"

if [ -n "$CONDUCTOR_SESSION" ]; then
  # Build completion summary
  SUMMARY="WORKER COMPLETE: $ISSUE_ID - $(git log -1 --format='%s' 2>/dev/null || echo 'committed')"

  # Send notification to conductor via tmux
  tmux send-keys -t "$CONDUCTOR_SESSION" -l "$SUMMARY"
  sleep 0.3
  tmux send-keys -t "$CONDUCTOR_SESSION" C-m

  echo "Notified conductor: $CONDUCTOR_SESSION"
else
  echo "No CONDUCTOR_SESSION set - conductor will detect completion via polling"
fi
```

## Atomic Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/conductor:verify-build` | Run build, report errors |
| `/conductor:run-tests` | Run tests if available |
| `/conductor:code-review` | Opus review with auto-fix |
| `/conductor:codex-review` | Codex review (read-only, cheaper) |
| `/conductor:commit-changes` | Stage + commit with conventional format |
| `/conductor:create-followups` | Create follow-up beads issues |
| `/conductor:update-docs` | Check/update documentation |
| `/conductor:close-issue` | Close beads issue |

---

## Custom Pipelines

Compose commands for custom workflows:

**Quick commit (skip review):**
```
/conductor:verify-build
/conductor:run-tests
/conductor:commit-changes
/conductor:close-issue <id>
```

**Review-focused (no commit):**
```
/conductor:verify-build
/conductor:code-review
```

---

## Error Handling

| Step | On Failure |
|------|------------|
| Build | Show errors, stop pipeline |
| Tests | Show failures, stop pipeline |
| Review | Show blockers, stop pipeline |
| Commit | Show git errors, stop pipeline |
| Follow-ups | Non-blocking - log and continue |
| Docs | Non-blocking - log and continue |
| Close | Show beads errors |
| Notify | Non-blocking - log and continue |

---

## Re-running After Fixes

If the pipeline stopped:
1. Fix the issues
2. Run `/conductor:worker-done` again

The pipeline is idempotent - safe to re-run.

---

## After Notification

When `/conductor:worker-done` succeeds:
- Issue is closed in beads
- Commit is on the feature branch
- Conductor notified (if CONDUCTOR_SESSION set)
- Worker's job is done

**The conductor then:**
- Merges the feature branch to main
- Kills this worker's tmux session
- Removes the worktree (if bd-swarm)
- Deletes the feature branch

Workers do NOT kill their own session - the conductor handles cleanup after receiving the notification.

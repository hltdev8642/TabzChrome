# Prompt Engineer - Context-Aware Prompt Crafting

Craft detailed, context-rich prompts for beads issues by first gathering codebase context via parallel exploration.

## Workflow

```
1. Receive issue(s) to prepare prompts for
2. Spawn parallel Explore agents (haiku) to gather context per issue
3. Synthesize findings into monster prompts
4. Return prompts ready for worker spawning
```

## Phase 1: Parallel Context Gathering

For each issue, spawn an Explore agent to gather:

```markdown
Task(
  subagent_type="Explore",
  model="haiku",
  prompt="For issue [ISSUE-ID]: [title]

  Find:
  - Key files that will need changes (with line numbers for relevant sections)
  - Existing patterns to follow (show examples)
  - Dependencies and imports
  - Related test files
  - Any similar past implementations to reference

  Return structured context, not recommendations."
)
```

Spawn these in parallel - one per issue. Haiku is fast and cheap.

## Phase 2: Prompt Synthesis

Using gathered context, craft prompts following these principles:

### Structure

```markdown
## Task: [ISSUE-ID] - [Title]
[Explicit, actionable description of what to do]

## Context
[Background and WHY this matters - gathered from exploration]

## Key Files
[Specific file paths with line numbers from exploration]
- `/path/to/file.ts:45-60` - [what's relevant here]
- `/path/to/other.ts:120` - [pattern to follow]

## Patterns to Follow
[Code examples from exploration showing existing patterns]

## Approach
[Implementation guidance based on codebase patterns]

Use subagents in parallel for exploration, testing, and multi-file analysis.

## When Done
Run `/conductor:worker-done [ISSUE-ID]`
```

### Prompt Principles

**Be explicit and specific:**
| Less Effective | More Effective |
|----------------|----------------|
| Fix the bug | Fix the null reference on line 45 of Terminal.tsx when resize fires before init |
| Improve the UI | Add loading state to button with disabled styling and spinner |
| Add error handling | Wrap WebSocket connection in try-catch to handle backend disconnections |

**Add context (explain WHY):**
```
Add try-catch around WebSocket connection to gracefully handle backend
disconnections. Currently users see a cryptic error when the backend restarts.
```

**Reference existing patterns:**
```
Follow the same error handling pattern used in useTerminalSessions.ts
(lines 45-60) for consistency.
```

**Avoid aggressive language** - Opus 4.5 follows instructions precisely:
| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| CRITICAL: You MUST | Use this when... |
| NEVER do X | Prefer Y because... |
| ALWAYS do Y | Default to Y for... |

## Phase 3: Return Prompts

Return all crafted prompts in a structured format:

```markdown
## Prepared Prompts

### [ISSUE-ID-1]
```prompt
[Full prompt content]
```

### [ISSUE-ID-2]
```prompt
[Full prompt content]
```
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Vague instructions | Gather specific file paths and line numbers via exploration |
| Missing context | Explain WHY behind each task |
| No patterns referenced | Find and include existing code patterns |
| Over-scoped prompts | Focus on the specific issue, not surrounding cleanup |
| Skill/agent matching | Let auto-hook handle this - don't manually specify skills |

## Model Selection

This skill runs as Opus (orchestrator) but spawns Haiku for exploration:
- **Haiku**: Fast parallel exploration, cheap context gathering
- **Opus**: Synthesis and prompt crafting requiring judgment

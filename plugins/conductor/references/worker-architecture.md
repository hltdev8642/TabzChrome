# Worker Architecture

This document describes the unified worker architecture for parallel issue processing with bd-swarm.

## Overview

```
Worker (vanilla Claude via tmux/TabzChrome)
  ├─> Gets context from `bd show <issue-id>`
  ├─> Receives explicit skill invocations in prompt (e.g., "/xterm-js:xterm-js")
  ├─> Invokes skills FIRST before starting work
  └─> Completes with /conductor:worker-done
```

## What Workers ARE

- **Vanilla Claude sessions** spawned via TabzChrome API or direct tmux
- **Same plugin context** as the conductor (all skills available)
- **Skill-aware** - workers receive skill hints in prompts and invoke skills directly
- **Issue-focused** - each worker receives issue context and completes the task

## What Workers are NOT

- **NOT specialized agents** - no worker-frontend.md, worker-backend.md, etc.
- **NOT plugin-isolated** - no `--plugin-dir ./plugins/worker-minimal`

## Worker Capabilities

Workers are full-powered Claude sessions with all natural capabilities:

- **Subagents** - parallel exploration, testing, multi-file analysis
- **Skills** - invoke directly when needed
- **MCP tools** - browser automation, beads, etc.
- **Full reasoning** - analyze deeply, break down complex problems

Trust Claude to use these appropriately. The conductor's job is:
1. Craft rich, context-loaded prompts
2. Manage worktrees and parallel execution
3. Handle merge/verification/cleanup at the end

## Skill Activation

**Skills auto-activate via the UserPromptSubmit hook** when workers receive prompts. The hook evaluates the prompt content against available skill descriptions and loads relevant ones automatically.

Each skill has a `description` in its frontmatter that Claude matches against:
- Task matches "terminal rendering, resize handling" → loads xterm-js skill
- Task matches "UI components, styling" → loads ui-styling skill
- Task matches "API development, backend" → loads backend-development skill

> **DO NOT put `/skill:name` in worker prompts.** Skills activate automatically based on task description.
> The only slash command workers need is `/conductor:worker-done` at the end.

**Write good task descriptions** - the more clearly the prompt describes what needs to be done, the better the hook can match relevant skills.

## Why This Architecture?

1. **Simplicity** - Workers are just Claude sessions, no special configuration
2. **Auto-activation** - Skills load from prompt keywords via UserPromptSubmit hook
3. **Flexible** - Same worker can handle any issue type based on prompt content
4. **Lean prompts** - File paths as text (not @file), keywords trigger skill loading

## Worker Lifecycle

```
1. Worktree   → setup-worktree.sh creates isolated directory (BEFORE spawn)
2. Spawn      → TabzChrome API or tmux creates session WITH CONDUCTOR_SESSION env var
3. Prompt     → Worker receives issue context + skill hint via tmux send-keys
4. Work       → Worker invokes skill when needed, reads files on-demand
5. Complete   → Worker runs /conductor:worker-done (notifies via CONDUCTOR_SESSION)
6. Cleanup    → Session killed, worktree merged/removed
```

> **CONDUCTOR_SESSION is required** - workers use it to notify the conductor when done.
> If not passed during spawn, workers complete silently.

## Worker Prompt Guidelines

These guidelines ensure workers receive clear, effective prompts that Claude 4.x models follow precisely.

### Be Explicit

Claude 4.x models follow instructions **precisely**. If you say "suggest changes," Claude will suggest—not implement.

| Less Effective | More Effective |
|----------------|----------------|
| Fix the bug | Fix the null reference error on line 45 of Terminal.tsx when resize callback fires before terminal is initialized |
| Improve the UI | Add loading state to the button with disabled styling and spinner icon |
| Can you suggest improvements? | Make these improvements to the code |

### Add Context (Explain WHY)

Claude generalizes from explanations. Provide motivation:

```text
# Less effective
Add error handling

# More effective
Add try-catch around the WebSocket connection to gracefully handle
backend disconnections. Currently users see a cryptic error.
```

### Reference Existing Patterns

Point workers to existing code for consistency:

```text
Follow the same error handling pattern used in useTerminalSessions.ts
(lines 45-60) for consistency.
```

### Soften Aggressive Language

Avoid ALL CAPS and aggressive phrasing—Claude 4.x may overtrigger:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| CRITICAL: You MUST use this tool | Use this tool when... |
| NEVER do X | Prefer Y over X because... |
| ALWAYS do Y | Default to Y for... |

### Prompt Structure

Use `/conductor:prompt-engineer` (forked context) to craft prompts. It generates:

```markdown
## Task: ISSUE-ID - Title
[Explicit, actionable description]

## Context
[Background and WHY - gathered via haiku exploration]

## Key Files
- /path/to/file.ts:45-60 - [what's relevant]
- /path/to/pattern.ts:120 - [pattern to follow]

## Approach
[Implementation guidance based on codebase patterns]

Use subagents in parallel for exploration, testing, and multi-file analysis.

## When Done
Run `/conductor:worker-done ISSUE-ID`
```

### Skill Activation

**Skills auto-activate** via the UserPromptSubmit hook based on prompt content. No manual `/skill:name` invocation needed in prompts.

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| ALL CAPS INSTRUCTIONS | Reads as shouting, may overtrigger | Normal case with clear structure |
| "Don't do X" | Negative framing is harder to follow | "Do Y instead" (positive framing) |
| Vague adjectives ("good", "proper") | Undefined, varies by interpretation | Specific criteria or examples |
| Including full file contents | Bloats prompt, may be stale | File paths as text, read on-demand |

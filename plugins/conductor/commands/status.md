# Status Dashboard

View the current state of workers, issues, and the conductor system.

## Usage

```bash
/conductor:status
```

## What It Shows

### 1. Active Workers

```bash
# List workers via TabzChrome API
curl -s http://localhost:8129/api/agents | jq '.data[] | {name, state, workingDir}'
```

Shows:
- Worker name (issue ID)
- State (Processing, Awaiting Input, etc.)
- Working directory (worktree path)

### 2. Issue Status

# Get issue counts by status
mcp__beads__stats()
```

Or via CLI:
```bash
bd stats
```

Shows:
- Total open issues
- Ready (unblocked, prepared)
- In progress (being worked)
- Blocked
- Recently closed

### 3. Ready Queue

mcp__beads__ready()
```

Shows issues that:
- Have no blockers
- Have `ready` label (prompt prepared)
- Are not epics

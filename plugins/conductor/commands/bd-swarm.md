# Beads Swarm - Parallel Issue Processing

Spawn multiple Claude workers to tackle beads issues in parallel, with skill-aware prompting and environment preparation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive: select issues and worker count
/conductor:bd-swarm

# Auto mode: process entire backlog autonomously
/conductor:bd-swarm --auto
```

## Workflow Overview

```
1. Get ready issues      →  bd ready
2. Create worktrees      →  git worktree add + npm install (parallel)
3. Wait for deps         →  All worktrees ready before workers spawn
4. Spawn workers         →  TabzChrome API or direct tmux (both create tmux sessions)
5. Send prompts          →  tmux send-keys with skill hints
6. Monitor via tmuxplexer →  Background window polling
7. Complete pipeline     →  Kill sessions → Merge → Remove worktrees → Sync → Push
```

**Key insight:** TabzChrome spawn creates tmux sessions. Cleanup is via `tmux kill-session`.

---

## Monitoring Workers

**Key change**: Instead of a watcher subagent, monitor workers directly via tmuxplexer in a background window.

### Spawn Monitor

```bash
# Spawn tmuxplexer --watcher as background window (window 2)
plugins/conductor/scripts/monitor-workers.sh --spawn
```

The monitor shows all AI sessions with:
- Status: idle, processing, tool_use, awaiting_input
- Context %
- Current tool

### Poll Status

```bash
# Get parsed worker statuses
plugins/conductor/scripts/monitor-workers.sh --status
# Output: ctt-worker-abc|tool_use|45

# Get summary
plugins/conductor/scripts/monitor-workers.sh --summary
# Output: WORKERS:3 WORKING:2 IDLE:0 AWAITING:1 STALE:0

# Check specific issue
plugins/conductor/scripts/monitor-workers.sh --check-issue TabzChrome-abc
# Output: CLOSED or OPEN
```

### Decision Logic

Poll every ~2 minutes and decide:

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `🔧 AskUserQuestion` | **Don't nudge** - worker waiting for user answer |
| `🔧 <other tool>` | Working, leave alone |
| `awaiting_input` / `idle` | At prompt - check if issue closed or stuck |
| `stale` (5+ min no activity) | May be hung, investigate pane |
| Issue closed | Worker done, ready for cleanup |

**Detection:** Tmuxplexer shows `🔧 Using AskUserQuestion` when worker has a question pending. Never nudge these workers.

### Drill Down

Only capture worker panes when needed:

```bash
tmux capture-pane -t <worker-session> -p -S -50
```

---

## Interactive Mode (Default)

### 1. Get Ready Issues

```bash
bd ready --json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.id): [\(.priority)] [\(.type)] \(.title)"' | head -5
```

### 2. Select Worker Count

Ask user: How many workers? (2, 3, 4, 5)

### 3. Create Worktrees (Parallel)

Create all worktrees and install dependencies in parallel, then wait for completion before spawning workers.

**Important**: Use file-based locking to prevent race conditions when multiple workers spawn simultaneously.

```bash
# Validate issue ID format (alphanumeric with dash only)
validate_issue_id() {
  [[ "$1" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || { echo "ERROR: Invalid issue ID" >&2; return 1; }
}

# Lockfile for worktree creation (prevents race conditions with parallel workers)
WORKTREE_LOCK="/tmp/git-worktree-$(basename "$PROJECT_DIR").lock"

# Function to setup a single worktree with deps
setup_worktree() {
  local ISSUE="$1"
  local WORKTREE="${PROJECT_DIR}-worktrees/${ISSUE}"

  mkdir -p -- "$(dirname "$WORKTREE")"

  # Use flock to serialize worktree creation across parallel workers
  # Lock is automatically released when subshell exits (success or error)
  (
    flock -x 200 || { echo "ERROR: Failed to acquire worktree lock" >&2; exit 1; }

    # Check if worktree already exists (another worker may have created it)
    if [ -d "$WORKTREE" ]; then
      echo "Worktree already exists: $WORKTREE"
      exit 0
    fi

    git worktree add -- "$WORKTREE" -b "feature/${ISSUE}" 2>/dev/null || \
    git worktree add -- "$WORKTREE" HEAD
  ) 200>"$WORKTREE_LOCK"

  # Install deps based on lockfile type (outside lock - can run in parallel)
  if [ -f "$WORKTREE/package.json" ] && [ ! -d "$WORKTREE/node_modules" ]; then
    cd -- "$WORKTREE"
    if [ -f "pnpm-lock.yaml" ]; then
      pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    elif [ -f "yarn.lock" ]; then
      yarn install --frozen-lockfile
    else
      npm ci 2>/dev/null || npm install
    fi
  fi

  echo "READY: $WORKTREE"
}

# Run all worktree setups in parallel
for ISSUE in TabzChrome-abc TabzChrome-def TabzChrome-ghi; do
  validate_issue_id "$ISSUE" || continue
  setup_worktree "$ISSUE" &
done

# Wait for ALL worktrees to be ready before spawning workers
wait
echo "All worktrees initialized with dependencies"
```

### 4. Spawn Workers

**How spawning works:**
- TabzChrome's `/api/spawn` (POST) creates tmux sessions with `ctt-*` prefix
- Direct tmux spawning uses `worker-*` prefix (also works fine)
- Both appear in tmuxplexer and can be monitored the same way
- **Sessions must be killed via tmux** - there is no REST API for cleanup

**Option A: Via TabzChrome API** (appears in browser terminal UI)

```bash
TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/tabz-auth-token)
ISSUE_ID="TabzChrome-abc"
WORKTREE="/home/user/project-worktrees/${ISSUE_ID}"

bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --status in_progress

# Safe JSON construction using jq (handles special characters in values)
JSON_PAYLOAD=$(jq -n \
  --arg name "worker-${ISSUE_ID}" \
  --arg dir "$WORKTREE" \
  --arg cmd "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" \
  '{name: $name, workingDir: $dir, command: $cmd}')

# POST creates a tmux session named ctt-worker-${ISSUE_ID}-xxxx
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -d "$JSON_PAYLOAD"

# Store session name for later cleanup (parse from response)
SESSION_ID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/spawn ... | jq -r '.terminal.id')
echo "$SESSION_ID" >> /tmp/swarm-sessions.txt
```

**Option B: Direct tmux** (simpler, CLI-only)

```bash
ISSUE_ID="TabzChrome-abc"
WORKTREE="/home/user/project-worktrees/${ISSUE_ID}"
SESSION="worker-${ISSUE_ID}"

bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --status in_progress

tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -c "$WORKTREE"
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" C-m

# Store session name for later cleanup
echo "$SESSION" >> /tmp/swarm-sessions.txt
```

### 5. Send Skill-Aware Prompts

**Security**: Validate session names and use heredoc for prompts with dynamic content.

```bash
SESSION="ctt-claude-xxx"
ISSUE_ID="TabzChrome-abc"
TITLE="Fix something"
DESCRIPTION="Details here"

sleep 4

# Validate session name format (alphanumeric, dash, underscore only)
if [[ ! "$SESSION" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Invalid session name format"
  exit 1
fi

if ! tmux has-session -t "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "ERROR: Session does not exist"
  exit 1
fi

# Use heredoc for safe multiline prompt with variables
# This avoids shell escaping issues with special characters in title/description

# Set autonomous mode marker if --auto flag was used
if [ "$AUTO_MODE" = "true" ]; then
  MODE_HEADER="**MODE: AUTONOMOUS**

Do NOT use AskUserQuestion. Make reasonable defaults for any ambiguity.
If truly blocked, close issue with reason 'needs-clarification' and create follow-up.

"
else
  MODE_HEADER=""
fi

PROMPT=$(cat <<EOF
## Task
${ISSUE_ID}: ${TITLE}

${MODE_HEADER}${DESCRIPTION}

## Skills
Run \`/ui-styling:ui-styling\` or \`/xterm-js\` based on task type.

## Completion
When done: \`/conductor:worker-done ${ISSUE_ID}\`
EOF
)

# Send prompt safely using printf to handle special characters
printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | tmux load-buffer -
tmux paste-buffer -t "$SESSION"
sleep 0.3
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" C-m
```

### 6. Start Monitor & Poll

```bash
# Spawn background monitor
plugins/conductor/scripts/monitor-workers.sh --spawn

# Poll every 2 minutes
while true; do
  SUMMARY=$(plugins/conductor/scripts/monitor-workers.sh --summary)
  echo "[$(date)] $SUMMARY"

  # Check if all issues closed
  ALL_CLOSED=true
  for ISSUE in $ISSUES; do
    # Validate issue ID before checking
    [[ "$ISSUE" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || continue
    if ! bd show "$ISSUE" 2>/dev/null | grep -q "Status: closed"; then
      ALL_CLOSED=false
      break
    fi
  done

  if $ALL_CLOSED; then
    echo "All issues closed - running completion pipeline"
    break
  fi

  sleep 120
done
```

### 7. Completion Pipeline

When all workers done, clean up in this order: **Sessions → Worktrees → Branches → Sync**

```bash
cd -- "$PROJECT_DIR"

# ============================================
# STEP 1: Kill worker tmux sessions
# ============================================
# Option A: From saved session list
if [ -f /tmp/swarm-sessions.txt ]; then
  while read -r SESSION; do
    [[ "$SESSION" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || continue
    if tmux has-session -t "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null; then
      tmux kill-session -t "$SESSION"
      echo "Killed session: $SESSION"
    fi
  done < /tmp/swarm-sessions.txt
  rm /tmp/swarm-sessions.txt
fi

# Option B: Kill by pattern (if session list not available)
for ISSUE in $ISSUES; do
  [[ "$ISSUE" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || continue
  # Try both naming conventions
  tmux kill-session -t "worker-${ISSUE}" 2>/dev/null && echo "Killed: worker-${ISSUE}"
  tmux list-sessions -F '#{session_name}' 2>/dev/null | grep "ctt-.*${ISSUE}" | while read -r S; do
    tmux kill-session -t "$S" 2>/dev/null && echo "Killed: $S"
  done
done

# ============================================
# STEP 2: Merge branches
# ============================================
MERGE_COUNT=0
for ISSUE in $ISSUES; do
  [[ "$ISSUE" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || { echo "Skipping invalid issue: $ISSUE" >&2; continue; }
  if git merge --no-edit -- "feature/${ISSUE}"; then
    MERGE_COUNT=$((MERGE_COUNT + 1))
  fi
done

# ============================================
# STEP 3: Cleanup worktrees and branches
# ============================================
for ISSUE in $ISSUES; do
  [[ "$ISSUE" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || continue
  git worktree remove --force -- "${PROJECT_DIR}-worktrees/${ISSUE}"
  git branch -d -- "feature/${ISSUE}"
done

echo "Worktrees cleaned up, $MERGE_COUNT branches merged"

# ============================================
# STEP 4: Audio summary of merge completion
# ============================================
AUDIO_TEXT="Wave complete. $MERGE_COUNT branches merged successfully. Worktrees cleaned up."
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/audio/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -n --arg text "$AUDIO_TEXT" '{text: $text, voice: "en-GB-SoniaNeural", rate: "+15%", priority: "high"}')" \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 &

# ============================================
# STEP 5: Sync and push
# ============================================
bd sync && git push origin main

# Final completion announcement
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/audio/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Sprint complete. All changes pushed to main.", "voice": "en-GB-SoniaNeural", "rate": "+15%", "priority": "high"}' \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

**Important:** Sessions MUST be killed before removing worktrees, otherwise Claude processes may hold file locks.

---

## Auto Mode (`--auto`)

Fully autonomous backlog completion. Runs until `bd ready` returns empty.

**Sets `AUTO_MODE=true`** - Workers receive `MODE: AUTONOMOUS` marker and will not ask questions.

### Wave Loop

```bash
WAVE=1
while true; do
  READY=$(bd ready --json | jq -r '.[].id')
  [ -z "$READY" ] && break

  echo "=== Wave $WAVE: $(echo "$READY" | wc -l) issues ==="

  # PHASE 1: Initialize ALL worktrees in parallel (deps included)
  for ISSUE in $READY; do
    [[ "$ISSUE" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || { echo "Skipping invalid: $ISSUE" >&2; continue; }
    setup_worktree "$ISSUE" &  # Uses function from section 3
  done
  wait  # Block until all worktrees ready with deps
  echo "All worktrees initialized for wave $WAVE"

  # PHASE 2: Spawn workers (worktrees already have deps)
  for ISSUE in $READY; do
    [[ "$ISSUE" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$ ]] || continue
    spawn_worker "$ISSUE"
  done

  # Monitor until wave complete
  monitor_wave "$READY"

  # Merge wave results
  merge_wave "$READY"

  # Audio announcement for wave completion
  ISSUE_COUNT=$(echo "$READY" | wc -w)
  curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/audio/speak \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$(jq -n --arg text "Wave $WAVE complete. $ISSUE_COUNT issues merged. Starting next wave." \
      '{text: $text, voice: "en-GB-SoniaNeural", rate: "+15%", priority: "high"}')" \
    > /dev/null 2>&1 &

  WAVE=$((WAVE + 1))
done

# Final completion with audio
bd sync && git push origin main
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/audio/speak \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Backlog complete! All waves finished and pushed to main.", "voice": "en-GB-SoniaNeural", "rate": "+15%", "priority": "high"}' \
  > /dev/null 2>&1 &
echo "Backlog complete!"
```

### Auto Mode Differences

| Aspect | Interactive | Auto |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Worker count | Ask user | All ready issues |
| Waves | One wave | Repeat until empty |
| Decisions | AskUserQuestion | Reasonable defaults |
| Context check | Manual | Auto /wipe at 75% |

### Context Recovery

If conductor hits 75% context:

```bash
# Save state
echo "$WAVE" > /tmp/conductor:bd-swarm-wave.txt

# Trigger /wipe with handoff
# Resume with: /conductor:bd-swarm --auto --resume
```

---

## Worker Expectations

Each worker will:
1. Read issue with `bd show <id>`
2. Implement feature/fix
3. Build and test
4. Run `/conductor:worker-done <issue-id>` (reviews, commits, closes issue)

---

## Skill Matching

Match skills to issue content:

| Keywords | Skill |
|----------|-------|
| terminal, xterm, pty | `/xterm-js` |
| ui, component, modal, button | `/ui-styling:ui-styling` |
| plugin, skill, agent | `/plugin-development:plugin-development` |
| debug, fix, error, bug | Debugging patterns |

---

## Notes

- Workers run in isolated worktrees (prevents conflicts)
- Monitor via tmuxplexer background window (no watcher subagent)
- User can switch to monitor window via status bar click
- Check actual pane content before nudging idle workers

## Session Cleanup Checklist

Before ending a swarm session, verify cleanup is complete:

```bash
# Check for leftover worker sessions
tmux list-sessions | grep -E "worker-|ctt-worker"

# Check for leftover worktrees
ls ${PROJECT_DIR}-worktrees/ 2>/dev/null

# Check for orphaned feature branches
git branch | grep "feature/"

# Manual cleanup if needed
tmux kill-session -t "worker-xxx"
git worktree remove --force "${PROJECT_DIR}-worktrees/xxx"
git branch -d "feature/xxx"
```

**Common issue:** If conductor session ends before completion pipeline runs, sessions/worktrees are orphaned. Always run the completion pipeline or clean up manually.

# Beads Swarm - Parallel Issue Processing

Spawn multiple Claude workers to tackle beads issues in parallel, with skill-aware prompting and environment preparation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Interactive: select issues and worker count
/conductor:bd-swarm

# Auto mode: process entire backlog autonomously
/conductor:bd-swarm --auto
```

## Workflow Overview

```
1. Get ready issues      ->  bd ready
2. Create worktrees      ->  scripts/setup-worktree.sh (parallel)
3. Wait for deps         ->  All worktrees ready before workers spawn
4. Spawn workers         ->  TabzChrome /api/spawn (see below)
5. Send prompts          ->  tmux send-keys with skill hints
6. Monitor               ->  scripts/monitor-workers.sh
7. Merge & review        ->  Merge branches, visual review (conductor only)
8. Cleanup               ->  scripts/completion-pipeline.sh
```

**Key insight:** TabzChrome spawn creates tmux sessions with `ctt-*` prefix. Cleanup is via `tmux kill-session`.

---

## Spawn Workers - Copy-Paste Example

**IMPORTANT**: Use this exact pattern to spawn workers via TabzChrome:

```bash
# 1. Get auth token and conductor session
TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/tabz-auth-token)
CONDUCTOR_SESSION=$(tmux display-message -p '#{session_name}')

# 2. Spawn worker with env vars (creates ctt-worker-ISSUE-xxxx tmux session)
# BD_SOCKET isolates beads daemon per worker (prevents conflicts in parallel workers)
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"name\": \"worker-$ISSUE_ID\", \"workingDir\": \"$WORKTREE_PATH\", \"command\": \"BD_SOCKET=/tmp/bd-worker-$ISSUE_ID.sock CONDUCTOR_SESSION='$CONDUCTOR_SESSION' claude --dangerously-skip-permissions\"}")

# 3. Extract session name from response
SESSION_NAME=$(echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.terminal.ptyInfo.tmuxSession // .terminal.id')
echo "Spawned: $SESSION_NAME"

# 4. Record session IDs in beads for audit trail
bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --notes "conductor_session: $CONDUCTOR_SESSION
worker_session: $SESSION_NAME
started_at: $(date -Iseconds)"

# 5. Wait for Claude to initialize, then send prompt
sleep 4
# Skills are already loaded in worker context - send prompt directly
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION_NAME" -l 'Your prompt here...'
sleep 0.3
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION_NAME" C-m
```

**Alternative - Direct tmux** (simpler, no TabzChrome UI):
```bash
SESSION="worker-$ISSUE_ID"
CONDUCTOR_SESSION=$(tmux display-message -p '#{session_name}')
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -c "$WORKTREE_PATH"
# BD_SOCKET isolates beads daemon per worker (prevents conflicts in parallel workers)
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" "BD_SOCKET=/tmp/bd-worker-$ISSUE_ID.sock CONDUCTOR_SESSION='$CONDUCTOR_SESSION' claude --dangerously-skip-permissions" C-m

# Record session IDs in beads for audit trail
bd update "$ISSUE_ID" --notes "conductor_session: $CONDUCTOR_SESSION
worker_session: $SESSION
started_at: $(date -Iseconds)"

sleep 4
# Skills are already loaded in worker context - send prompt directly
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" -l 'Your prompt here...'
sleep 0.3
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION" C-m
```

## Worker Completion Notifications

Workers notify the conductor when done via API (push-based, no polling, no session corruption):

```
Worker completes → /conductor:worker-done
                 → POST /api/notify with worker-complete type
                 → WebSocket broadcasts to conductor
                 → Conductor receives and cleans up immediately
```

**How it works:**
1. Worker completes task and runs `/conductor:worker-done`
2. Worker calls `POST /api/notify` with completion details
3. Backend broadcasts via WebSocket to all connected clients
4. Conductor receives notification and can cleanup immediately
5. No polling needed - workers push completion status via API

**Why API over tmux send-keys:** The old tmux-based notification could corrupt the conductor's Claude session if it was mid-output or mid-prompt. The API broadcasts via WebSocket, which the conductor receives cleanly without interrupting its session.

**API notification pattern:**
```bash
TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/tabz-auth-token)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8129/api/notify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Auth-Token: $TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"type\": \"worker-complete\", \"issueId\": \"$ISSUE_ID\", \"summary\": \"commit message\", \"session\": \"$WORKER_SESSION\"}"
```

**Spawn command (BD_SOCKET isolates beads daemon per worker):**
```bash
"command": "BD_SOCKET=/tmp/bd-worker-$ISSUE_ID.sock claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

---

## Fallback: Polling (if notifications fail)

See: `references/bd-swarm/monitoring.md`

```bash
# Poll status
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/monitor-workers.sh --summary
# Output: WORKERS:3 WORKING:2 IDLE:0 AWAITING:1 STALE:0
```

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `AskUserQuestion` | Don't nudge - waiting for user |
| `<other tool>` | Working, leave alone |
| `idle` / `awaiting_input` | Check if issue closed or stuck |
| Issue closed | Ready for cleanup |

---

## Interactive Mode

**See full details:** `references/bd-swarm/interactive-mode.md`

1. Get ready issues: `bd ready`
2. Ask user for worker count (2-5)
3. Create worktrees in parallel:
   ```bash
   for ISSUE in $ISSUES; do
     ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/setup-worktree.sh "$ISSUE" &
   done
   wait
   ```
4. Spawn workers via TabzChrome API or direct tmux
5. Send skill-aware prompts with issue context
6. Monitor via `monitor-workers.sh --summary` every 2 min
7. Run completion pipeline when all issues closed

---

## Auto Mode (`--auto`)

**See full details:** `references/bd-swarm/auto-mode.md`

Fully autonomous backlog completion. Runs waves until `bd ready` is empty.

**Conductor behavior:** No user questions, make reasonable defaults, loop until backlog empty.

| Aspect | Interactive | Auto |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Worker count | Ask user | All ready issues |
| Waves | One wave | Loop until empty |
| Decisions | AskUserQuestion ok | No questions |
| Context | Manual check | Auto /wipe at 75% |

---

## Completion Pipeline

**See full details:** `references/bd-swarm/completion-pipeline.md`

### Full Closeout (Recommended)

Use the wave-done skill for comprehensive closeout with code review:

```bash
# Full pipeline: verify -> merge -> build -> review -> cleanup -> push -> summary
/conductor:wave-done $ISSUES
```

This runs all 9 steps: verify workers closed, kill sessions, merge branches, build verification, unified code review, cleanup worktrees, visual QA (if UI changes), sync & push, comprehensive summary.

### Quick Cleanup (Skip Review)

For trivial changes or when you want to review manually:

```bash
# Quick: kill sessions -> merge -> cleanup -> audio notification
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/completion-pipeline.sh "$ISSUES"
```

**When to use which:**

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Production work, multiple workers | `/conductor:wave-done` (full) |
| Trivial changes, single worker | `completion-pipeline.sh` (quick) |
| Need to review manually | `completion-pipeline.sh` then manual review |

**Visual review happens at conductor level** (after merge):
- Conductor opens browser tabs for UI verification
- No tab conflicts since workers are done
- Full context of all merged changes

---

## Worker Expectations

Each worker will:
1. Read issue: `bd show <id>`
2. Implement feature/fix
3. Build and test
4. Complete: `/conductor:worker-done <issue-id>`

**Workers do NOT do visual review.** Visual review (browser-based UI verification) happens at the conductor level after merge. This prevents parallel workers from fighting over browser tabs.

### Self-Service Optimization (Optional)

Workers can self-optimize before starting real work:

```
1. Worker receives basic prompt from conductor
2. Worker runs /conductor:worker-init (or spawns prompt-enhancer agent)
3. Issue is analyzed, skills identified, enhanced prompt crafted
4. Context reset (/clear) and enhanced prompt auto-submitted
5. Worker now has full context budget for implementation
```

**When to use:** Complex issues where context optimization helps. Skip for simple fixes.

See `commands/worker-init.md` and `agents/prompt-enhancer.md`.

---

## Worker Architecture

Workers are vanilla Claude sessions that receive skill-aware prompts:

```
Worker (vanilla Claude via tmux/TabzChrome)
  ├─> Gets context from `bd show <issue-id>`
  ├─> Receives skill hint in prompt (e.g., "use /xterm-js:xterm-js skill")
  ├─> Invokes skill directly when needed
  └─> Completes with /conductor:worker-done
```

Workers share the same plugin context as the conductor, so all skills are available.

---

## Skill Matching & Prompt Enhancement

**Key insight:** Workers need detailed prompts with skill hints woven naturally into guidance, not listed as sidebars.

### Reading Skills from Beads

Skills are persisted by `plan-backlog` in issue notes. Read them using the central script:

```bash
# The script self-locates (checks CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, script dir, project, plugin cache)
MATCH_SCRIPT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-./plugins/conductor}/scripts/match-skills.sh"

# Get skill trigger text for an issue (reads from notes first, falls back to matching)
SKILL_HINTS=$($MATCH_SCRIPT --issue "$ISSUE_ID")

# Or for runtime-verified matching (only available skills):
SKILL_HINTS=$($MATCH_SCRIPT --verify --issue "$ISSUE_ID")
```

**The workflow:**
1. `plan-backlog` analyzes issues and persists skills to notes
2. `bd-swarm` reads skills from notes (or matches on-the-fly if not persisted)
3. Workers receive natural skill trigger language in their prompts

### Skill Mappings

See `scripts/match-skills.sh` for the complete, authoritative list of skill mappings. Key patterns:

| Keywords | Skill to Invoke |
|----------|-----------------|
| terminal, xterm, pty, resize | `/xterm-js` |
| UI, component, modal, dashboard | `/ui-styling` |
| backend, api, server, websocket | `/backend-development` |
| plugin, skill, agent, conductor | `/plugin-dev` |
| browser, screenshot, click, mcp | (use tabz_* MCP tools directly) |

**Key insight**: Neither "Use the X skill" nor "follow X patterns" triggers invocation. Workers need explicit `/skill-name` commands in a "Skills to Load" section.

### Enhanced Prompt Structure

All worker prompts must follow this structure (see `references/worker-architecture.md`):

```markdown
Fix beads issue ISSUE-ID: "Title"

## Skills to Load
**FIRST**, invoke these skills before starting work:
- /backend-development:backend-development
- /conductor:orchestration

These load patterns and context you'll need.

## Context
[Description from bd show - explains WHY]

## Key Files
[Relevant file paths, or "Explore as needed"]

## Approach
[Implementation guidance - what to do, not which skills to use]

After implementation, verify the build passes and test the changes work as expected.

## When Done
Run: /conductor:worker-done ISSUE-ID

This command will: build, run code review, commit changes, and close the issue.
```

**CRITICAL: Use full `plugin:skill` format for skill invocation.**

To find actual available skills, run:
```bash
./plugins/conductor/scripts/discover-skills.sh "backend api terminal"
```

This discovers real skills from the API and filesystem - don't use shorthand names.

| ❌ Wrong format | ✅ Correct format |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| `/backend-development` | `/backend-development:backend-development` |
| `/xterm-js` | `/xterm-js:xterm-js` |
| `/plugin-dev` | `/conductor:orchestration` (or actual skill name) |

**Exception:** Project-level skills (in `.claude/skills/`) can use shorthand: `/tabz-guide`

**The `/conductor:worker-done` instruction is mandatory** - without it, workers don't know how to signal completion and the conductor can't clean up.

**The conductor session is in the prompt text** (not just env var) so workers can reliably notify completion even if CONDUCTOR_SESSION env var is lost.

See `references/bd-swarm/interactive-mode.md` for the `match_skills()` function that auto-generates skill hints.

## Notes

- Workers run in isolated worktrees (prevents conflicts)
- **BD_SOCKET isolates beads daemon per worker** - prevents daemon conflicts when multiple workers run `bd` commands simultaneously (beads v0.45+)
- Monitor via tmuxplexer background window (no watcher subagent)
- Check actual pane content before nudging idle workers
- Sessions MUST be killed before removing worktrees
- **Visual review happens at conductor level only** - workers skip it to avoid browser tab conflicts (see TabzChrome-s19)

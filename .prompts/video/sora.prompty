# Sora Video Generation via Browser Automation

Generate AI videos using TabzChrome MCP tools.

## Quick Start

```
Generate a {{duration:10s|15s}} video of {{subject:a cozy coding scene}}
```

## Fillable Fields

| Field | Options | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `{{duration}}` | 10s, 15s | 15s uses more credits |
| `{{aspect}}` | 16:9, 9:16 | Landscape, portrait |
| `{{style}}` | cinematic, anime, realistic, artistic | Add to prompt |
| `{{subject}}` | (free text) | Main subject of video |

## Workflow

### 1. Open Sora Drafts Page (has prompt input + shows your videos)
```bash
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_open_url '{"url": "https://sora.chatgpt.com/drafts"}'
```

### 2. Wait for page load, then fill prompt
```bash
# Wait 2-3 seconds for page to load
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_fill '{"selector": "textarea", "value": "{{prompt}}"}'
```

### 3. Submit (Click Create video)
```bash
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_click '{"selector": "div.flex.items-center.justify-between > div:last-child > button:last-child"}'
```

### 4. Wait for generation (60-120 seconds)
Videos appear in "Drafts" section when complete.

```bash
# Check for completion notification or thumbnail change
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_screenshot '{}'
```

### 5. Save generated video
Download videos to:
```
.prompts/AI_Videos/
```
Create folder if it doesn't exist. Contents are gitignored (your videos stay local).

## Key Selectors

| Element | Selector |
|---------|----------|
| Prompt textarea | `textarea` |
| Create video button | `div.flex.items-center.justify-between > div:last-child > button:last-child` |
| Settings button | `button#radix-:rj:` (near textarea) |
| Profile link | `div.flex.flex-col.items-center a:last-of-type` |
| Drafts card (on profile) | `a.relative.block.h-full.w-full.overflow-hidden` |
| Video thumbnail | `video` |

## URLs

| Page | URL | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Drafts | `sora.chatgpt.com/drafts` | **Start here** - has prompt + your videos |
| Profile | `sora.chatgpt.com/profile` | Shows drafts card (blurred preview) |
| Explore | `sora.chatgpt.com/explore` | Community videos feed |

## First-Time Setup

On first video creation, Sora shows a **Media Upload Agreement** modal:
1. Check all 4 checkboxes: `[role=checkbox]`
2. Click Accept button

After accepting once, it won't show again.

## Duration Options

Sora supports:
- **10 seconds** - Standard (default)
- **15 seconds** - Longer scenes (uses more credits)

Access via Settings button near the prompt input.

## Prompt Structure (Recommended Framework)

Think of prompting "like briefing a cinematographer who has never seen your storyboard."

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **1. Style** | Establish aesthetic first: "1970s film", "16mm grainy", "IMAX-scale cinematic" |
| **2. Scene** | Characters, costumes, setting, weather - concrete visuals, not vague |
| **3. Cinematography** | Camera shot type, framing, mood |
| **4. Actions** | Specific beats with timing: "takes 3 steps, pauses, turns in final second" |
| **5. Lighting + Palette** | Light quality AND color anchors: "warm lamp fill, cool rim from window. Palette: amber, cream, walnut" |

### Replace Vague with Concrete

| ❌ Weak | ✅ Strong |
|---------|-----------|
| "A beautiful street at night" | "Wet asphalt, zebra crosswalk, neon signs reflecting in puddles" |
| "Actor walks across the room" | "Actor takes four steps to window, pauses, pulls curtain in final second" |
| "Brightly lit room" | "Soft window light with warm lamp fill, cool rim from hallway" |

## Example Prompts

### Developer/Tech Scene (TabzChrome vibe)
```
16mm film look, cozy lo-fi aesthetic.

A developer in a dark hoodie sits at a cluttered desk, face lit by monitor glow.
Rain streaks down a window behind them. Warm desk lamp casts amber fill,
cool blue rim light from the monitor.

Medium shot, static camera. Developer clicks mouse, Chrome sidebar slides open
revealing terminal tabs with green/cyan text. They type four keystrokes,
pause, lean back as AI text streams across screen in final 3 seconds.

Palette: deep charcoal, amber lamp glow, cyan terminal highlights,
rain-diffused window light.
```

### Product Demo
```
Clean modern product demo style, soft depth-of-field, subtle shadows.

Browser window fills frame, crisp UI, white background.
Smooth tracking shot right-to-left following cursor.

Beat 1: Cursor clicks extension icon, sidebar slides in from right (2s).
Beat 2: Three terminal tabs appear with colorful syntax highlighting (2s).
Beat 3: Cursor clicks between tabs, text scrolls smoothly (remaining time).

Lighting: soft diffused, no harsh shadows. Palette: white, slate gray,
accent purple on active elements.
```

### Abstract/Artistic
```
Blade Runner meets Matrix aesthetic. 35mm anamorphic, heavy blue-orange grade.

Glowing terminal windows float in a rain-drenched neon cityscape.
Binary rain falls through holographic UI layers. Camera slowly pushes forward
through three depth layers: foreground code particles, midground floating
terminals, background neon towers.

Single smooth dolly push, 8 seconds. Lens flares bloom as camera passes
light sources in final 2 seconds.

Palette: deep midnight blue shadows, electric cyan terminals, orange neon accents.
```

## Tips

### From Official Sora Prompting Guide

1. **Style is your strongest lever** - Establish aesthetic in first line (era, film stock, look)
2. **One move per shot** - One camera movement + one subject action keeps it clean
3. **Actions in beats** - Describe with timing: "pauses 2 seconds, then turns"
4. **Concrete over vague** - Specific nouns and visible details, not adjectives
5. **Palette anchors** - Name 3-4 colors for highlight, midtone, shadow
6. **Lighting quality** - Specify direction, softness, and color temperature
7. **Remix to iterate** - "Same shot, switch to 85mm" or "same lighting, new palette"
8. **Simplify when it fails** - Freeze camera, reduce action, clear background, then layer back

### Workflow Tips

1. **Start from Drafts** - Has prompt input + shows all your generated videos
2. **Multiple videos** - Queue several prompts, they generate in parallel
3. **Same prompt = different results** - This is intentional, not a bug. Run twice for variety

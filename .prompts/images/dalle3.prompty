# DALL-E 3 Image Generation via ChatGPT

Generate images using browser automation with TabzChrome MCP tools.

## Quick Start

```
Generate a {{subject:robot avatar}} in {{style:photorealistic|digital art|watercolor|oil painting|3D render|pixel art|minimalist|anime}} style, {{aspect:square|wide|portrait}}
```

## Fillable Fields

| Field | Options | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `{{subject}}` | (free text) | What to generate |
| `{{style}}` | photorealistic, digital art, watercolor, oil painting, 3D render, pixel art, minimalist, anime | Art style |
| `{{aspect}}` | square, wide, portrait | Image dimensions |
| `{{mood}}` | bright, dark, moody, warm, cool, vibrant | Lighting/color tone |

## Workflow

### 1. Open ChatGPT DALL-E 3
```bash
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_open_url '{"url": "https://chatgpt.com/g/g-iLoR8U3iA-dall-e3"}'
```
Direct URL to DALL-E 3 GPT - skips navigation!

### 2. Wait for page load, then fill prompt
```bash
# Wait 2-3 seconds for page to load
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_fill '{"selector": "#prompt-textarea", "value": "{{prompt}}"}'
```

### 3. Submit
```bash
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_click '{"selector": "button[data-testid=\"composer-button-create-image\"]"}'
```

### 4. Wait and capture result (15-30 seconds for generation)
```bash
mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_screenshot '{}'
```

### 5. Save generated image
Download or save images to:
```
.prompts/AI_Images/
```
Create folder if it doesn't exist. Contents are gitignored (your images stay local).

## Key Selectors

| Element | Selector |
|---------|----------|
| Prompt input | `#prompt-textarea` |
| Create image button | `button[data-testid="composer-button-create-image"]` |
| Model selector | `button.group.flex.cursor-pointer` |
| DALL-E in sidebar | `a[href*="dall-e"]` |

## Multiple Images

DALL-E 3 now supports generating multiple images at once! Include quantity in your prompt:

```
"Generate 4 variations of a friendly robot avatar with different color schemes"
```

Or be specific:
```
"Create 3 images: 1) robot waving, 2) robot thinking, 3) robot celebrating"
```

## Prompt Structure (From OpenAI Guide)

DALL-E 3 uses GPT-4 to auto-expand your prompts. Very detailed prompts get significantly better results.

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|-----------------|
| **1. Subject** | Lead with the most important element first |
| **2. Details** | Specific visual attributes (not vague adjectives) |
| **3. Style** | Use "photo style" not "photorealistic" |
| **4. Technical** | Lighting, lens (subtle influence), composition |

### What Works

| Do This | Instead Of |
|---------|------------|
| "A robot with..." | "Create an image of..." |
| "Photo style" | "Photorealistic" |
| Describe positively | "No X", "Without Y" |
| "Pearl in night sky" | "Moon" (avoids template) |
| "Multi-image collection" | Just asking for variations |

### What Doesn't Work

- **Negations**: "no", "not", "without" are processed literally and often ignored
- **Counting**: "3 apples" fails—DALL-E can't count accurately
- **Instructional language**: "create", "visualize", "imagine" triggers meta-artifacts
- **"Close to camera"**: Adds unwanted cameras/hands in frame
- **Character consistency**: Can't reuse same character across images (use montage instead)

### Technical Limits

- **Max prompt**: 4,000 characters
- **Effective tokens**: ~256 processed, only 30-40 translate to visual elements
- **Sizes**: 1024×1024, 1792×1024 (wide), 1024×1792 (portrait)
- **Styles**: `vivid` (hyper-real, default) or `natural` (subdued, good for logos)

## Example Prompts

### Avatar (Structured)
```
A friendly robot, round head, glowing blue eyes, silver metallic body, warm smile.
Clean white background, centered composition.
Digital art style, soft shadows, vibrant colors.
```

### Logo (Use 'natural' style)
```
Minimalist logo, tech startup "TabzChrome".
Stylized browser tab with terminal cursor blink.
Vector style, clean lines, works on dark and light backgrounds.
Monochrome with single accent color.
```

### Scene (Lead with subject)
```
Developer at cluttered desk, three monitors showing code, late night.
Warm desk lamp casting amber glow, cool blue monitor light on face.
Rain streaks on window behind, city lights bokeh through glass.
Photo style, shallow depth of field, moody lo-fi aesthetic.
```

## Tips

### From Official OpenAI Guide

1. **Lead with subject** - Most important element first, details after
2. **Use "photo style"** - Not "photorealistic" for realistic images
3. **Avoid negations** - Describe what you want, not what you don't
4. **Simple mood words** - "dark", "chaotic", "cozy" guide effectively
5. **Style parameter** - Use `natural` for logos/stock, `vivid` for cinematic
6. **Montage for stories** - Request "multi-image collection" for variations
7. **Prioritize composition** - Don't list too many objects (30-40 elements max translate)
8. **Avoid text in images** - Or add "For unlettered viewers only" to reduce gibberish

### Workflow Tips

1. **Direct URL** - Use the direct GPT URL to skip navigation
2. **Multiple images** - Ask for "4 variations" or numbered scenes
3. **HD quality** - Adds ~10s, costs more, but finer details

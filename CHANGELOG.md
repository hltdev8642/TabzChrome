### Fixed
- **Duplicate audio in popouts** - Popout windows no longer play audio announcements (sidebar handles all audio)

- **Single-Terminal Popout Mode** - Popout windows now show only one terminal with minimal UI:
  - No tab bar, no chat bar, no header clutter - just the terminal
  - Fixes display corruption when multiple windows rendered the same terminal
  - Each popout is a dedicated view of one terminal

---

## [1.2.16] - 2025-12-25

### Changed
- **Simplified light/dark mode for gradients** - Light mode now shows muted/softer versions of the same gradient (not bright white):
  - Each gradient has a `lightGradient` property - a softer variant that retains the color character

  - Removed 8 bright light-only gradients (pure-white, soft-cream, paper, etc.)
  - Light mode is now usable with Claude Code's light syntax highlighting themes

  - **Panel Color** (13 presets): Base solid color shown through gradient transparency
  - **Transparency Slider** (0-100%): Controls gradient visibility over panel color
- **Footer customize button** (🎨) - Floating button in bottom-right of each terminal:
  - Opens popover with text colors, background, panel color, transparency controls
  - Changes are per-terminal and don't save to profile (temporary overrides)
  - Purple indicator shows when terminal has active overrides
  - Reset button to return to profile defaults
- **5 new aesthetic themes** from original Tabz:
  - Cyberpunk - Neon cyan/magenta with glow
  - Vaporwave - Retro pink/cyan aesthetic

  - Click `[changelog](CHANGELOG.md)` to open in new tab
  - External links still open in browser
- **Dashboard section persistence** - Active section saved to localStorage
  - Remembers which page you were on after refresh
  - Sidebar collapsed state also persisted
- **Files section caching** - New `FilesContext` for persistent state
  - Open files and active tab preserved across dashboard tab switches
  - File tree cached (only refetches on path change or manual refresh)

### Changed
- Tab icons now use colored icons matching file tree (green=code, blue=md, orange=json, yellow=image, purple=video, emerald=csv)
- `useWorkingDirectory` hook now exports `isLoaded` flag for timing coordination

### Fixed
- **File tree loading home directory on refresh** - Fixed path mismatch between tilde (`~/projects/X`) and expanded (`/home/user/projects/X`) paths that caused cache misses and duplicate fetches
- **Working directory persistence race condition** - Added `isLoaded` guards to prevent stale `~` from being written to Chrome storage during initial load

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-22

### Changed
- **No CDP required!** All 26 MCP tools now use Chrome Extension APIs exclusively
  - No `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag needed to launch Chrome
  - No puppeteer-core dependency (smaller install, faster startup)
  - Simpler setup - just install extension and start backend

### Removed
- **`tabz_get_api_response` tool** - Removed due to browser security restrictions preventing response body capture via Extension APIs. Use `tabz_get_network_requests` to see request metadata (URL, method, status, timing)

### Updated
- Documentation cleanup across all files:
  - GitHub Pages (`docs/pages/mcp-tools.html`) - Updated tool list and requirements section
  - README.md - Simplified MCP setup instructions
  - WSL2_SETUP.md - Completely rewritten (much simpler now)
  - All skills and agents updated to remove CDP references
  - Dashboard MCP Settings page updated

## [1.2.17] - 2025-12-25

### Fixed
- **Light mode now works properly** - Panel colors and gradients adapt correctly:

---

## [1.2.16] - 2025-12-25

### Changed
- **Simplified light/dark mode for gradients** - Light mode now shows muted/softer versions of the same gradient (not bright white):
  - Each gradient has a `lightGradient` property - a softer variant that retains the color character

  - Removed 8 bright light-only gradients (pure-white, soft-cream, paper, etc.)
  - Light mode is now usable with Claude Code's light syntax highlighting themes

  - **Panel Color** (13 presets): Base solid color shown through gradient transparency
  - **Transparency Slider** (0-100%): Controls gradient visibility over panel color
- **Footer customize button** (🎨) - Floating button in bottom-right of each terminal:

  - Reset button to return to profile defaults
- **5 new aesthetic themes** from original Tabz:
  - Cyberpunk - Neon cyan/magenta with glow
  - Vaporwave - Retro pink/cyan aesthetic

- **State-tracker hooks** - Plugin now properly references `hooks.json` file instead of inline config
- **State-tracker robustness** - Prevents script exit on corrupted JSON files, uses atomic writes
- **3D Focus settings sync** - WebGL/Canvas toggle now syncs with sidebar settings

### Changed
- **tui-expert model** - Upgraded from haiku to opus for better reasoning
- **README plugin docs** - Fixed broken links, added complete plugin table with correct paths

---

## [1.1.15] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- **Context window percentage on tabs** - Claude terminal tabs now display context usage:
  - Shows percentage on far right of tab (e.g., "62%")
  - Color-coded to match statusline thresholds: green (<50%), yellow (50-74%), red (75%+)
  - Tooltip includes context percentage
  - Persists even when Claude is idle
- **Audio alerts for context thresholds** - New notification events in Settings → Audio:
  - **Context warning** - Announces when context reaches 50%
  - **Context critical** - Announces when context reaches 75%
  - Uses hysteresis to only announce once per threshold crossing

### Fixed
- **State-tracker preserves claude_session_id** - Fixed race condition where state-tracker would overwrite the `claude_session_id` field set by statusline, causing context percentage to disappear from tabs
- **WebGL renderer now shows diffs and box-drawing correctly** - Changed WebGL background from semi-transparent to fully opaque. All themes now use solid `black` colors matching their gradient starts instead of transparent. High-contrast dark uses pure `#000000` for maximum contrast.
- **Detach now announces "detached" instead of "closed"** - Fixed race condition where audio announcement fired before detach flag was set
- **Reattached terminals restore original profile name** - When recovering terminals from ghost badge, the matched profile's name (including emoji) is now restored instead of showing just the sanitized name

### Documentation
- Added statusline example to state-tracker plugin (`examples/statusline-with-context.sh`)
- Added setup guide for context window display (`examples/README.md`)

---

## [1.1.14] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- **3D Focus Mode** - Immersive terminal experience in a dedicated browser tab:
  - Right-click any terminal tab → "🧊 Open in 3D Focus"
  - Terminal floats in 3D space with starfield background
  - **Controls:** Scroll to zoom (1.5x-25x), mouse to orbit, F2 to lock camera, Esc to unfocus terminal
  - Preserves terminal's theme, font size, and font family from profile
  - Auto-returns to sidebar when 3D tab closes or extension reloads

### Fixed
- **Stale 3D focus state** - Terminals no longer get stuck showing "Viewing in 3D" after extension reload

---

## [1.1.13] - 2025-12-19

### Added
- **View as Text** - New feature to capture terminal output as selectable, copyable text:
  - Right-click any terminal tab → "📄 View as Text"
  - Dashboard Terminals page: Eye icon next to each terminal
  - Opens in dashboard with full scrollback (no truncation)
  - **Copy All** button for clipboard
  - **Save as Markdown** exports with metadata (timestamp, working directory, git branch)

### Fixed
- **Terminal resize comments** - Corrected code comments to accurately describe the resize trick as "rows-1, then fit" (not cols).

---

## [1.1.12] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed
- **State-tracker plugin SubagentStop hook** - Added missing `SubagentStop` hook to `hooks/hooks.json`. Previously only defined in `plugin.json`, causing subagent counts to never decrement when Task agents completed. This resulted in persistent robot emoji indicators in the statusline and terminal tabs.

---

## [1.1.11] - 2025-12-18

### Fixed
- **Dashboard profile drag-drop** - Fixed profiles not being draggable in grid/list view. Nested button elements were capturing mouse events; restructured to use pointer-events-none on content areas.
- **Cross-category drag-drop** - Profiles can now be dragged between categories. When dropped into a different category, the profile's category is automatically updated.
- **Drop indicators visibility** - Changed drop indicator color from theme variable to explicit green (#22c55e) for better visibility.

### Changed
- **MCP Inspector buttons** - Split into "Start Server" and "Open Inspector" buttons. This allows opening the inspector in the current Chrome browser instead of the system default browser.

---

## [1.1.10] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **Dashboard Profiles drag-drop reordering** - Drag profiles to reorder within/across categories, drag category headers to reorder categories. Visual drop indicators for grid (left/right) and list (above/below) views.
- **Dashboard Profiles theme gradients** - Profile cards now display their theme's background gradient, making it easy to visually distinguish profiles.
- **Dashboard Profiles default indicator** - Star badge shows which profile is the default (used by Spawn API when no profile specified).
- **Dashboard Profiles auto-sync** - Profile cards update automatically when you change settings in the sidebar (no refresh needed).
- **MCP Inspector launcher** - New button in dashboard MCP Settings and sidebar MCP tab to launch the official MCP Inspector for interactive tool testing at localhost:6274.

### Changed
- Renamed "MCP Playground" to "MCP Settings" in dashboard navigation (better reflects its purpose as a configuration page).

### Fixed
- Dashboard GitHub link now points to correct repository (GGPrompts/TabzChrome).

---

## [1.1.9] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **WebGL/Canvas renderer toggle** - New setting to switch between WebGL (crispest text, GPU-accelerated) and Canvas (universal compatibility) renderers. WebGL provides sharper text rendering but requires dark mode due to transparency limitations.

### Technical
- WebGL renderer automatically uses 50% background opacity for compatibility with gradient backgrounds
- Canvas renderer uses fully transparent backgrounds for maximum gradient visibility
- Light mode is disabled when WebGL is enabled (WebGL has rendering issues with transparent backgrounds in light mode)
- Added 150ms delay before reload when toggling renderer to ensure Chrome storage propagates

---

## [1.1.8] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- **Plugin system restructure** - Plugins are now individually toggleable via `~/.claude/settings.json`. Enable with `"state-tracker@tabz-chrome": true`
- **State-tracker as installable plugin** - Audio notifications and status tracking now available as a separate plugin that can be installed from the TabzChrome repository
- **Dependency checks in `dev.sh`** - Script now checks for required (Node.js, npm, tmux) and optional (edge-tts, Nerd Fonts) dependencies with platform-specific install instructions
- **Port cleanup in dev.sh** - Automatically kills processes on port 8129 when restarting backend
- **Cross-platform support** - macOS users get Homebrew commands if available, otherwise direct download links

### Fixed
- **Fixed double audio notifications** - Audio no longer plays twice when Claude finishes a task
- **Fixed audio not playing on first terminal spawn** - Audio settings now load before first session announcement
- **Fixed state tracker permission_prompt handling** - Permission prompts no longer incorrectly change Claude's status
- **Fixed state tracker subagent completion** - Status correctly returns to `awaiting_input` when all subagents finish
- **Fixed TTS audio 500 errors** - Updated edge-tts CLI arguments for v7.x (`--rate` instead of `-r`, `--write-media` instead of `-o`)
- **Fixed /rebuild command** - Auto-detects Windows username instead of hardcoding

### Documentation
- Fixed incorrect `--dynamic-tool-discovery` flag → use `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_MCP_CLI=true` env var
- Added edge-tts v6.0+ to requirements table in README
- Improved onboarding docs for cross-platform users

---

## [1.1.7] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Context menu "Open Terminal Sidebar" now works** - Fixed the context menu action that was silently failing to open the sidebar
- **Persist selected terminal tab across sidebar refresh** - The active terminal tab selection is now saved and restored when the sidebar is refreshed or reopened

---

## [1.1.6] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- **`tabId` parameter for parallel tab operations** - `tabz_screenshot`, `tabz_screenshot_full`, `tabz_click`, and `tabz_fill` now accept an optional `tabId` parameter to target specific tabs without switching. Enables multi-agent workflows where Claude can operate on multiple browser tabs simultaneously.

---

## [1.1.5] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Fixed MCP tools targeting wrong browser tab** - Screenshots, clicks, and other MCP operations now correctly target the user's actual focused tab instead of always defaulting to the first tab. The fix stores the tab URL alongside the Chrome tab ID and matches CDP pages by URL.

---

## [1.1.4] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed
- **Fixed terminal corruption when bookmarks bar appears/disappears** - Changed resize trick to shrink by row instead of column, preventing tmux status bar from wrapping during resize. Also added buffer-clearing protection for row delta changes in ResizeObserver
- **Fixed dev.sh version check showing wrong direction** - Version comparison now correctly checks if remote is newer than local (was showing "update available 1.1.3 → 1.1.1")

---

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-16

### Fixed

#### Terminal Resize Stability
- **Fixed terminal corruption when resizing sidebar** - Clearing xterm buffer before large dimension changes (>5 columns) prevents reflow algorithm from corrupting complex ANSI sequences (Claude Code statusline, colored diffs)
- **Fixed isWrapped crash** - Protected all `clear()` calls with resize lock to prevent "Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'isWrapped')" error during concurrent writes
- **Fixed blank screen after sidebar refresh** - Improved resize trick timing ensures tmux redraws content correctly after page refresh

These fixes significantly improve stability when:
- Resizing Chrome sidebar while Claude Code is outputting
- Refreshing the sidebar during active terminal sessions
- Switching between tabs during heavy terminal output

---

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-15

### Fixed
- **Remove personal data from git** - `backend/.settings.json` and `mcp-config.json` now gitignored
- **Safe MCP defaults** - YOLO mode (allowAllUrls) now OFF by default, minimal tools enabled
- **Safe working directory defaults** - Recent dirs defaults to `['~']` only, no hardcoded paths
- **Console spam removed** - Debug logging removed from audio and Claude status hooks

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-15

### Changed

#### Default Font Changed to Monospace
- **Default font is now `monospace`** instead of `JetBrains Mono NF` - Works out of the box on all systems without installing fonts
- **Fixes character spacing issues** on systems without Nerd Fonts installed

### Added

#### Bundled Nerd Fonts
- **`fonts/` folder** with pre-bundled Nerd Fonts (16MB total):
  - JetBrains Mono NF (Regular + Bold)
  - Fira Code NF (Regular + Bold)
  - Caskaydia Cove NF (Regular + Bold)
- **Simple install instructions** in `fonts/README.md` for Windows, macOS, and Linux

#### Platform-Aware Font List
- **Font dropdown now filters by platform** - Windows-only fonts (Consolas, Cascadia Code/Mono) hidden on macOS/Linux
- **Trimmed font list** from 11 to 8 options - removed unbundled Nerd Fonts that required manual download

### Fixed
- **Terminal spacing/gaps issue** when default font not installed - now falls back gracefully to system monospace

---

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed

#### Terminal Corruption After Long Idle
- **Fixed terminal display corruption when returning after idle** - When Chrome service worker goes idle (30+ seconds), WebSocket disconnects. Previously, reconnection didn't resync the terminal, causing xterm.js and tmux buffers to be out of sync. Now triggers a resize trick on reconnect which forces tmux to redraw, resyncing the display.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-14

**First Public Release** - Full Linux terminals in your Chrome sidebar!

### Highlights

- **Real bash terminals** in your browser sidebar (not a web emulator)
- **Persistent sessions** powered by tmux - terminals survive sidebar close, browser restart
- **20 MCP tools** for Claude Code browser automation (screenshots, clicks, network capture)
- **Profile system** with categories, color-coded tabs, and smart directory inheritance
- **Claude Code status detection** with emoji indicators and optional voice announcements

### Added

#### Manual Token Input for External Launchers
- **Extension Settings: "API Token" button** - Click to reveal "Copy Token" button that copies auth token to clipboard
- **GitHub Pages launcher: Token input field** - Paste token once, stored in localStorage for persistence
- **Improved UX for external sites** - Users consciously authorize sites by pasting their token instead of auto-fetch

#### TTS Long Text Support
- **Handles long text-to-speech requests** - Text over 5000 characters now uses temp file input instead of command line
- **Dynamic timeout scaling** - Timeout scales with text length (10s base + 1s per 1000 chars, max 120s)

### Fixed

#### Terminal Corruption During Refresh While Working
- **Fixed copy mode and corruption when refreshing sidebar during active Claude output** - Three-part fix:
  - Disabled tmux `client-attached` and `after-select-pane` hooks that sent `refresh-client` during reconnection
  - Added 1000ms output guard to buffer initial output flood during reconnection
  - Added forced resize trick after guard lifts (sends SIGWINCH to exit copy mode)

#### Sidebar Resize Corruption During Active Output
- **Fixed terminal corruption when resizing sidebar while Claude is outputting** - Made `fitTerminal()` abort after max deferrals instead of forcing fit during continuous output

#### Ghost Badge Instant Updates
- **Ghost badge now updates immediately** on terminal spawn/close/detach instead of waiting for 30-second poll

#### Tmux Config Consistency
- **dev.sh and pty-handler.js now force xterm.js-optimized tmux config** - Ensures consistent behavior regardless of how tmux server was started
- **Fixed "can't find window: 0" error** - Works with any tmux `base-index` setting

---

## [2.7.4] - 2025-12-12

### Security Fixes (Pre-Release Audit)

#### CRITICAL - Backend Security
- **Fixed command injection in edge-tts** (`server.js`) - Replaced shell interpolation with `execFile()` and added input validation for voice/rate parameters
- **Added WebSocket authentication** (`server.js`, `background.ts`) - Token-based auth with 64-char random token written to `/tmp/tabz-auth-token` (mode 0600); extension auto-fetches token from `/api/auth/token` before connecting
- **Added path traversal protection** (`pty-handler.js`) - Validates working directory is within `$HOME` or `/tmp`

#### CRITICAL - Extension Security
- **Removed dangerous eval()** (`background.ts`) - Replaced arbitrary code execution with safe predefined operations for MCP execute_script
- **Restricted host_permissions** (`manifest.json`) - Changed from `<all_urls>` to specific domains: localhost:8129, github.com, gitlab.com
- **Restricted externally_connectable** (`manifest.json`) - Limited from `localhost:*/*` to `localhost:8129/*` only
- **Removed unused permissions** (`manifest.json`) - Removed cookies, history, bookmarks (were reserved but unused)

#### Accessibility (WCAG)
- **Added ARIA labels** - 30+ accessibility fixes across sidepanel.tsx, SettingsModal.tsx, ProfileDropdown.tsx, WorkingDirDropdown.tsx, GhostBadgeDropdown.tsx
- **Added semantic roles** - dialog, menu, menuitem, listbox, option, tablist, tab, tabpanel
- **Added aria-expanded/aria-selected** - Proper state indicators for interactive elements

#### Production Infrastructure
- **Enhanced health check endpoint** (`GET /api/health`) - Now returns human-readable memory sizes (MB), proper package version, timestamps
- **Added PM2 ecosystem config** (`ecosystem.config.js`) - Production-ready process management with logging, graceful shutdown, auto-restart
- **Created logs directory** - `backend/logs/` for PM2 log output with .gitignore

#### Tests & Maintenance
- **Fixed test failures** - Updated fetch mock in setup.ts, fixed assertions in useProfiles.test.ts and useWorkingDirectory.test.ts
- **CHANGELOG rotation** - Moved v1.0.0-2.5.0 to CHANGELOG-archive.md (743→218 lines)
- **Version sync** - Aligned package.json, manifest.json to 2.7.4

### New Features

#### Local Dashboard (localhost:8129)
- **Modular dashboard structure** - New multi-page dashboard at `http://localhost:8129`
- **Dashboard home** (`index.html`) - Quick stats, active terminals, working directory selector
- **Terminals page** (`terminals.html`) - Full terminal list with kill/reattach, orphan management
- **Shared CSS/JS** - `css/dashboard.css` (dark theme) and `js/dashboard.js` (WebSocket, API helpers)
- **Updated AI Launcher** - Now includes nav bar consistent with other dashboard pages
- **Dashboard button in sidebar** - New grid icon in header opens dashboard in browser tab

#### Working Directory Sync API
- **New `/api/settings/working-dir` endpoint** - GET/POST for working directory settings
- **Extension to Dashboard sync** - Working directory and recent dirs shared between extension and dashboard
- **Persisted to disk** - Settings stored in `backend/.settings.json`

### Bug Fixes

#### Tab Name Bug (API Spawn)
- **Fixed profile matching** - Terminals spawned via API now keep their custom names
- **Root cause**: Profile matching used `startsWith()` which incorrectly matched "Claude & TFE" to any "Claude: ..." terminal
- **Fix**: Changed to exact match with full sanitized name extraction from terminal ID

#### Dashboard z-index
- **Fixed dropdown z-index** - Working directory dropdown no longer appears behind other cards
- **Added `.card-with-dropdown` class** - Ensures proper stacking context

Files changed:
- `backend/routes/api.js` - Added settings API endpoints
- `backend/public/index.html` - New dashboard home page
- `backend/public/terminals.html` - New terminals management page
- `backend/public/css/dashboard.css` - Shared dashboard styles
- `backend/public/js/dashboard.js` - Shared WebSocket/API helpers

---

## [2.7.3] - 2025-12-12

### Enhancements

#### AI Image Download Support
- **`tabz_download_image` now works with ChatGPT/Copilot** - Automatically extracts full CDN URLs with auth tokens
- **URL extraction from page** - Uses `tabz_execute_script` to get the actual `src` attribute (not just selector matching)
- **Direct download for HTTPS URLs** - Routes through `downloadFile` for reliable downloads
- **Extension-based capture fallback** - Added `browser-capture-image` handler for future blob URL support

**Recommended selectors for AI platforms:**
- ChatGPT: `img[src*='oaiusercontent.com']`
- General: `img[src*='cdn']`

Files changed:
- `extension/background/background.ts` - Added `handleBrowserCaptureImage()` handler
- `backend/routes/browser.js` - Added `/api/browser/capture-image` route
- `backend/server.js` - Added `browser-capture-image-result` WebSocket handler
- `tabz-mcp-server/src/client.ts` - Rewrote `downloadImage()` to extract URLs and use direct download
- `tabz-mcp-server/MCP_TOOLS.md` - Updated documentation with AI image examples

### Bug Fixes

#### GitHub FAB Star Button
- **Fixed Star button selector** - Changed from `form.unstarred` to `form[action$="/star"]`
- **Added "already starred" detection** - FAB now shows feedback when repo is already starred

#### UI Polish
- **Default font changed to JetBrains Mono NF** - Better ligatures and icon support
- **Suppressed sidePanel.open() error logs** - Cleaner console output

---

## [2.7.2] - 2025-12-11

### Bug Fixes

#### Terminal Corruption During WebSocket Reconnect
- **Extended output quiet period** - Increased from 150ms to 500ms to prevent resize during active Claude streaming
- **Increased max deferrals** - From 5 to 10 (up to 5 seconds of waiting for output to quiet)
- **Staggered REFRESH_TERMINALS** - Random 50-550ms delay per terminal prevents simultaneous redraws
- **Skip refresh during active output** - If output happened <100ms ago, skip the refresh entirely
- **Removed send-keys from resize path** - `tmux send-keys ''` on first resize was redundant (SIGWINCH already triggers redraw) and could cause corruption during active output

Root cause: When WebSocket reconnects, REFRESH_TERMINALS triggered `triggerResizeTrick()` on ALL terminals simultaneously. Each resize sends SIGWINCH to tmux, which redraws the screen. During active Claude output, these redraws interleaved with streaming content, causing the same lines to appear repeated many times.

Files changed:
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx` - Output-aware deferral, staggered refresh
- `backend/server.js` - Removed send-keys from resize handler

---

## [2.7.1] - 2025-12-11

### Bug Fixes

#### Terminal Redraw Storm Fix
- **Fixed terminal corruption** - Same line appearing repeated many times (20x, 57x, etc.)
- **Root cause**: Multiple `triggerResizeTrick()` calls in rapid succession caused tmux to redraw screen content many times
- **REFRESH_TERMINALS deduplication** - Now sent once (500ms) instead of twice (200ms + 700ms)
- **Removed redundant refresh-client** - PTY resize already sends SIGWINCH, extra refresh-client was unnecessary
- **Added debounce to triggerResizeTrick** - 500ms minimum between calls prevents redraw storms
- **Removed duplicate post-connection refresh** - Terminal.tsx no longer calls triggerResizeTrick at 1200ms (handled by REFRESH_TERMINALS)

Files changed:
- `extension/hooks/useTerminalSessions.ts` - Single REFRESH_TERMINALS at 500ms
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx` - Debounce triggerResizeTrick, removed redundant call
- `backend/modules/pty-handler.js` - Removed refresh-client after resize

---

## [2.7.0] - 2025-12-09

### Major Features

#### Profile Categories with Color-Coded Tabs
- **Category Field** - Optional category for each profile (e.g., "Claude Code", "TUI Tools", "Gemini")
- **Collapsible Groups** - Profiles grouped by category with expand/collapse headers
- **9-Color Palette** - Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, Red, Yellow, Cyan, Pink, Gray
- **Inline Color Picker** - Click color dots next to category header to change color
- **Color-Coded Tabs** - Selected terminal tabs show category color (background tint, text, border)
- **Search Bar** - Filter profiles by name, command, or category
- **Autocomplete** - Category input suggests existing categories from other profiles
- **Category Settings Persistence** - Colors and collapsed state saved to Chrome storage
- Files: `extension/components/SettingsModal.tsx`, `extension/sidepanel/sidepanel.tsx`

#### Claude Status Shows Profile Name
- **Profile Name in Ready State** - When Claude is idle, shows "Ready Claude Worker" instead of "Ready"
- **Easier Multi-Claude Identification** - Visual status now matches audio announcements
- Files: `extension/hooks/useClaudeStatus.ts`, `extension/sidepanel/sidepanel.tsx`

### Technical Details

- **New Types** - `CategorySettings` interface, `CATEGORY_COLORS` palette constant
- **Real-time Updates** - Category color changes broadcast via CustomEvent to update tabs immediately
- **Profile Schema** - Added optional `category?: string` field to Profile interface

---

## [2.6.0] - 2025-12-09

### Major Features

#### Auto-Voice Assignment for Claude Sessions
- **Unique Voices per Session** - Each Claude session automatically gets a different voice from a pool of 10
- **Voice Pool** - Andrew, Emma, Sonia, Ryan, Natasha, William, Brian, Aria, Guy, Jenny (US/UK/AU accents)
- **Round-Robin Assignment** - First session gets Andrew, second gets Emma, etc.
- **Profile Override Priority** - Profile voice settings still take precedence over auto-assigned voice
- **Tell Sessions Apart by Ear** - Hear "Sonia ready" vs "Andrew ready" to know which Claude finished
- Files: `extension/sidepanel/sidepanel.tsx`

#### Audio Settings UX Refactor
- **Per-Profile Audio Settings** - Moved audio configuration from Audio tab into each profile's edit form
- **Audio Mode Dropdown** - Three options per profile:
  - "Use default" - Follows header toggle and global defaults
  - "Enabled" - Always plays (respects master mute)
  - "Disabled" - Never plays, even when header audio is on
- **Voice/Rate Overrides** - Optional per-profile voice and speech rate settings
- **Simplified Audio Tab** - Renamed to "Claude Audio", now only shows global defaults (voice, rate, volume, events)
- **Removed Profile Overrides Section** - No longer needed since settings are in profiles
- Files: `extension/components/SettingsModal.tsx`, `extension/sidepanel/sidepanel.tsx`

#### Header Mute Button
- **Quick Mute Toggle** - Speaker icon in header between keyboard and settings icons
- **Master Mute** - One click to silence all audio notifications
- **Visual Feedback** - Green when active, gray when muted or disabled
- **Persisted State** - Mute preference saved to Chrome storage
- Files: `extension/sidepanel/sidepanel.tsx`

### Bug Fixes

- **Tab switching flash** - Removed scheduleTmuxRefresh workaround that caused terminals to flash when switching tabs (actual fix was moving tmux status bar to top)

---

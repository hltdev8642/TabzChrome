## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

#### Tmux Config Consistency
- **dev.sh now loads xterm.js-optimized tmux config** - Added `-f` flag and `source-file` command to ensure `.tmux-terminal-tabs.conf` is always applied, even if tmux server was started from Windows Terminal with different settings
- **Fixed "can't find window: 0" error** - Removed hardcoded `:0` window index in `tmux-session-manager.js` that failed when `base-index 1` is set; now uses session name without window index (works with any base-index)

These fixes prevent terminal rendering issues (emoji width mismatches, display corruption) that occurred when the tmux server was started with Windows Terminal's config but TabzChrome expected xterm.js settings.

## [2.7.4] - 2025-12-12

### Security Fixes (Pre-Release Audit)

#### CRITICAL - Backend Security
- **Fixed command injection in edge-tts** (`server.js`) - Replaced shell interpolation with `execFile()` and added input validation for voice/rate parameters
- **Added WebSocket authentication** (`server.js`, `background.ts`) - Token-based auth with 64-char random token written to `/tmp/tabz-auth-token` (mode 0600); extension auto-fetches token from `/api/auth/token` before connecting
- **Added path traversal protection** (`pty-handler.js`) - Validates working directory is within `$HOME` or `/tmp`

#### CRITICAL - Extension Security
- **Removed dangerous eval()** (`background.ts`) - Replaced arbitrary code execution with safe predefined operations for MCP execute_script
- **Restricted host_permissions** (`manifest.json`) - Changed from `<all_urls>` to specific domains: localhost:8129, github.com, gitlab.com
- **Restricted externally_connectable** (`manifest.json`) - Limited from `localhost:*/*` to `localhost:8129/*` only
- **Removed unused permissions** (`manifest.json`) - Removed cookies, history, bookmarks (were reserved but unused)

#### Accessibility (WCAG)
- **Added ARIA labels** - 30+ accessibility fixes across sidepanel.tsx, SettingsModal.tsx, ProfileDropdown.tsx, WorkingDirDropdown.tsx, GhostBadgeDropdown.tsx
- **Added semantic roles** - dialog, menu, menuitem, listbox, option, tablist, tab, tabpanel
- **Added aria-expanded/aria-selected** - Proper state indicators for interactive elements

#### Production Infrastructure
- **Enhanced health check endpoint** (`GET /api/health`) - Now returns human-readable memory sizes (MB), proper package version, timestamps
- **Added PM2 ecosystem config** (`ecosystem.config.js`) - Production-ready process management with logging, graceful shutdown, auto-restart
- **Created logs directory** - `backend/logs/` for PM2 log output with .gitignore

#### Tests & Maintenance
- **Fixed test failures** - Updated fetch mock in setup.ts, fixed assertions in useProfiles.test.ts and useWorkingDirectory.test.ts
- **CHANGELOG rotation** - Moved v1.0.0-2.5.0 to CHANGELOG-archive.md (743→218 lines)
- **Version sync** - Aligned package.json, manifest.json to 2.7.4

### New Features

#### Local Dashboard (localhost:8129)
- **Modular dashboard structure** - New multi-page dashboard at `http://localhost:8129`
- **Dashboard home** (`index.html`) - Quick stats, active terminals, working directory selector
- **Terminals page** (`terminals.html`) - Full terminal list with kill/reattach, orphan management
- **Shared CSS/JS** - `css/dashboard.css` (dark theme) and `js/dashboard.js` (WebSocket, API helpers)
- **Updated AI Launcher** - Now includes nav bar consistent with other dashboard pages
- **Dashboard button in sidebar** - New grid icon in header opens dashboard in browser tab

#### Working Directory Sync API
- **New `/api/settings/working-dir` endpoint** - GET/POST for working directory settings
- **Extension to Dashboard sync** - Working directory and recent dirs shared between extension and dashboard
- **Persisted to disk** - Settings stored in `backend/.settings.json`

### Bug Fixes

#### Tab Name Bug (API Spawn)
- **Fixed profile matching** - Terminals spawned via API now keep their custom names
- **Root cause**: Profile matching used `startsWith()` which incorrectly matched "Claude & TFE" to any "Claude: ..." terminal
- **Fix**: Changed to exact match with full sanitized name extraction from terminal ID

#### Dashboard z-index
- **Fixed dropdown z-index** - Working directory dropdown no longer appears behind other cards
- **Added `.card-with-dropdown` class** - Ensures proper stacking context

Files changed:
- `backend/routes/api.js` - Added settings API endpoints
- `backend/public/index.html` - New dashboard home page
- `backend/public/terminals.html` - New terminals management page
- `backend/public/css/dashboard.css` - Shared dashboard styles

## [2.7.3] - 2025-12-12

### Enhancements

#### AI Image Download Support
- **`tabz_download_image` now works with ChatGPT/Copilot** - Automatically extracts full CDN URLs with auth tokens
- **URL extraction from page** - Uses `tabz_execute_script` to get the actual `src` attribute (not just selector matching)
- **Direct download for HTTPS URLs** - Routes through `downloadFile` for reliable downloads
- **Extension-based capture fallback** - Added `browser-capture-image` handler for future blob URL support

**Recommended selectors for AI platforms:**
- ChatGPT: `img[src*='oaiusercontent.com']`
- General: `img[src*='cdn']`

Files changed:
- `extension/background/background.ts` - Added `handleBrowserCaptureImage()` handler
- `backend/routes/browser.js` - Added `/api/browser/capture-image` route
- `backend/server.js` - Added `browser-capture-image-result` WebSocket handler
- `tabz-mcp-server/src/client.ts` - Rewrote `downloadImage()` to extract URLs and use direct download
- `tabz-mcp-server/MCP_TOOLS.md` - Updated documentation with AI image examples

### Bug Fixes

#### GitHub FAB Star Button
- **Fixed Star button selector** - Changed from `form.unstarred` to `form[action$="/star"]`
- **Added "already starred" detection** - FAB now shows feedback when repo is already starred

#### UI Polish
- **Default font changed to JetBrains Mono NF** - Better ligatures and icon support
- **Suppressed sidePanel.open() error logs** - Cleaner console output

## [2.7.2] - 2025-12-11

### Bug Fixes

#### Terminal Corruption During WebSocket Reconnect
- **Extended output quiet period** - Increased from 150ms to 500ms to prevent resize during active Claude streaming
- **Increased max deferrals** - From 5 to 10 (up to 5 seconds of waiting for output to quiet)
- **Staggered REFRESH_TERMINALS** - Random 50-550ms delay per terminal prevents simultaneous redraws
- **Skip refresh during active output** - If output happened <100ms ago, skip the refresh entirely
- **Removed send-keys from resize path** - `tmux send-keys ''` on first resize was redundant (SIGWINCH already triggers redraw) and could cause corruption during active output

Root cause: When WebSocket reconnects, REFRESH_TERMINALS triggered `triggerResizeTrick()` on ALL terminals simultaneously. Each resize sends SIGWINCH to tmux, which redraws the screen. During active Claude output, these redraws interleaved with streaming content, causing the same lines to appear repeated many times.

Files changed:
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx` - Output-aware deferral, staggered refresh
- `backend/server.js` - Removed send-keys from resize handler

---

## [2.7.1] - 2025-12-11

### Bug Fixes

#### Terminal Redraw Storm Fix
- **Fixed terminal corruption** - Same line appearing repeated many times (20x, 57x, etc.)
- **Root cause**: Multiple `triggerResizeTrick()` calls in rapid succession caused tmux to redraw screen content many times
- **REFRESH_TERMINALS deduplication** - Now sent once (500ms) instead of twice (200ms + 700ms)
- **Removed redundant refresh-client** - PTY resize already sends SIGWINCH, extra refresh-client was unnecessary
- **Added debounce to triggerResizeTrick** - 500ms minimum between calls prevents redraw storms
- **Removed duplicate post-connection refresh** - Terminal.tsx no longer calls triggerResizeTrick at 1200ms (handled by REFRESH_TERMINALS)

Files changed:
- `extension/hooks/useTerminalSessions.ts` - Single REFRESH_TERMINALS at 500ms
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx` - Debounce triggerResizeTrick, removed redundant call
- `backend/modules/pty-handler.js` - Removed refresh-client after resize

## [2.6.0] - 2025-12-09

### Major Features

#### Auto-Voice Assignment for Claude Sessions
- **Unique Voices per Session** - Each Claude session automatically gets a different voice from a pool of 10
- **Voice Pool** - Andrew, Emma, Sonia, Ryan, Natasha, William, Brian, Aria, Guy, Jenny (US/UK/AU accents)
- **Round-Robin Assignment** - First session gets Andrew, second gets Emma, etc.
- **Profile Override Priority** - Profile voice settings still take precedence over auto-assigned voice

### Fixed
- **Dashboard hash navigation** - Clicking reference links now navigates between sections:
  - App listens for `hashchange` events to switch active section
  - FilesContext listens for `hashchange` to open files from URL path parameter
  - Fixes: clicking profile reference badge now opens file in Files viewer

- **Popout window close handling** - Closing a popout terminal window now properly:
  - Removes the tab from sidebar (was stuck showing "Popped Out" placeholder)
  - Detaches terminal to appear as ghost/orphan for respawning
  - Uses reliable `chrome.windows.onRemoved` listener instead of unreliable `beforeunload` + `sendBeacon`
  - "Return to Sidebar" button returns terminal without detaching

- **Audio mute toggle now respects TTS from slash commands** - The sidebar header mute button now properly silences:
  - TTS from `/api/audio/speak` (used by slash commands like `/ctthandoff`)
  - Direct audio playback from `/api/audio/play`
  - Bug: handlers in useEffect captured stale `audioGlobalMute` state
  - Fix: uses ref to access current mute value in stale closures

### Added
- **Video/Image Background Support** - Set videos or images as terminal backgrounds:
  - Per-profile background media settings (image/video/none)
  - Supports local files (~/path) and URLs (http/https)
  - Video formats: mp4, webm, mov (loops silently, muted)
  - Image formats: jpg, png, gif, webp, svg
  - Opacity slider to control media visibility (0-100%)
  - Media layer renders behind gradient overlay
  - Graceful fallback to panel color if file not found

- **Media Serving Endpoint** - `GET /api/media?path=<filepath>`:
  - Resolves `~` to home directory
  - Validates file extension for security
  - Supports video seeking with range requests
  - Caches media for 1 hour

# Profile Discovery Assistant

Scan the user's system for installed CLI tools and help them create TabzChrome profiles.

> **Note**: There is no API to edit profiles directly. Profiles are stored in Chrome storage and can only be modified via the Settings UI. This skill generates JSON files for the user to import.

## Instructions

1. **Check existing profiles first** to avoid duplicates. Use the profiles API:

```bash
# Get all profiles from TabzChrome (requires backend running)
curl -s http://localhost:8129/api/browser/profiles | jq
```

This returns:
- `profiles[]` - Array of all configured profiles
- `defaultProfileId` - Which profile spawns on "+"
- `globalWorkingDir` - The header working directory

Note which tools already have profiles (match by `command` field) to avoid duplicates.

2. Scan for installed CLI tools by running these checks:

```bash
# AI CLIs
for cmd in claude codex gemini aider opencode ollama gpt sgpt cursor; do
  command -v $cmd &>/dev/null && echo "✓ $cmd: $(which $cmd)"
done

# TUI Tools
for cmd in lazygit htop btop btm ranger mc ncdu tig lazydocker k9s yazi lf nnn broot; do
  command -v $cmd &>/dev/null && echo "✓ $cmd: $(which $cmd)"
done

# Editors
for cmd in nvim vim micro nano hx emacs code; do
  command -v $cmd &>/dev/null && echo "✓ $cmd: $(which $cmd)"
done

# System/Dev
for cmd in docker kubectl npm pnpm yarn tmux screen; do
  command -v $cmd &>/dev/null && echo "✓ $cmd: $(which $cmd)"
done
```

3. **AI Assistant Setup** - Ask specifically about AI tools they use:

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- question: "Which AI assistants do you use?"
- header: "AI Tools"
- multiSelect: true
- options:
  - "Claude Code" (if installed)
  - "Aider" (if installed)
  - "Codex/GPT" (if installed)
  - "Other/None"
```

**If Claude Code is selected**, ask follow-up questions:

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- question: "How do you prefer to run Claude Code?"
- header: "Claude Mode"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - "YOLO mode (--dangerously-skip-permissions) - Claude can edit/run without asking (Recommended)"
  - "Safe mode - Claude asks before file edits and commands"
  - "Both - create profiles for each mode"
```

Then ask about the Conductor agent (available via TabzChrome plugin):

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- question: "Add Claude Conductor profile? (multi-session orchestrator from TabzChrome)"
- header: "Conductor"
- multiSelect: false
- options:
  - "Yes - add Claude Conductor profile"
  - "No thanks"
```

If yes, add a profile with command: `claude --agent conductor`
(Note: Requires the conductor plugin from TabzChrome marketplace to be installed)

4. **Interactive Selection Loop** - Use `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true` to let users pick remaining tools:

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- question: "Which tools would you like to add as profiles?"
- header: "Add Profiles"
- multiSelect: true
- options: List the found tools that don't already have profiles (max 4 per question)
```

**IMPORTANT**: Continue the loop! After each selection:
- Confirm what was selected (e.g., "Added: lazygit, btop, htop")
- Ask "What would you like to do next?" with options:
  - "Show more tools" - continue with next batch of found tools
  - "Add a custom command" - ask for command name and details
  - "Browse awesome-tuis for ideas" - open https://github.com/rothgar/awesome-tuis in browser
  - "Done - generate profiles" - exit loop and generate JSON

Keep looping until user chooses "Done". This ensures they can:
- Select from multiple batches (since AskUserQuestion only shows 4 options at a time)
- Add custom commands not in the initial scan
- Discover new tools to install from curated lists
- Review selections before finalizing

5. **Before generating**, show a summary of selected profiles and ask for confirmation:

```
Use AskUserQuestion tool with:
- question: "Ready to create X profiles? (list them)"
- header: "Confirm"
- options:
  - "Yes, generate profiles"
  - "No, let me change selections"
```

6. For each selected tool, generate a profile JSON with:
   - Sensible `name` (e.g., "Claude Code", "LazyGit")
   - Appropriate `category` for grouping
   - Correct `command` to launch the tool
   - Empty `workingDir` (inherits from header)
   - Good defaults: `fontSize: 16`, `fontFamily: "JetBrains Mono"`, `themeName: "high-contrast"`

7. Output the complete JSON array and **save it to the user's Downloads folder** so they can import directly:

```bash
# Save to Downloads folder (same location Import looks by default)
# For WSL:
echo '$JSON_CONTENT' > "/mnt/c/Users/$USER/Downloads/new-profiles.json"
# Or use the path from tabz_get_downloads to find the correct Downloads folder
```

Tell the user: "I've saved the profiles to your Downloads folder. In TabzChrome, go to Settings (⚙️) → Profiles → Import and select `new-profiles.json`"

## Reading Existing Profiles

**Preferred method** - Use the profiles API (no export needed):

```bash
# Get all profiles directly from Chrome storage
curl -s http://localhost:8129/api/browser/profiles | jq '.profiles[] | {name, command}'
```

**Fallback** - If backend is not running, ask user to export:

1. Tell user: "Click **Export** in Settings (⚙️) → Profiles tab"
2. Find the downloaded file:
   ```bash
   mcp-cli call tabz/tabz_get_downloads '{"limit": 5, "state": "complete"}'
   ```
3. Read using the `wslPath` field from download info

Match existing profiles by the `command` field to avoid duplicates.

## Profile Schema

Each profile has these fields:

```typescript
{
  id: string           // Unique ID (lowercase, use slug of name + random suffix)
  name: string         // Display name
  category?: string    // Category for grouping (e.g., "AI Assistants", "TUI Tools")
  command?: string     // Starting command (empty = just bash)
  workingDir: string   // Working directory (empty = inherit from header)
  fontSize: number     // Font size (14-20 typical)
  fontFamily: string   // Font family (e.g., "JetBrains Mono, monospace")
  themeName: string    // Theme: "high-contrast", "dracula", "ocean", "neon", "amber", "matrix"
  backgroundGradient?: string  // Background gradient name (e.g., "midnight", "forest")
  panelColor?: string  // Panel/chrome color (e.g., "zinc", "slate", "neutral")
  transparency?: number // Background transparency (0-100)
  reference?: string   // Reference doc URL or file path (shown as 📎 badge)
  audioOverrides?: {   // Optional per-profile audio settings
    mode?: string      // "default" | "enabled" | "disabled"
    voice?: string     // Voice override
    rate?: string      // Rate override (e.g., "+20%")
  }
}
```

## Example Output Format

**IMPORTANT:** The import expects a `profiles` wrapper object, not a raw array!

```json
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "id": "claude-yolo-12345",
      "name": "Claude YOLO",
      "category": "AI Assistants",
      "command": "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions",
      "workingDir": "",
      "fontSize": 16,
      "fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, monospace",
      "themeName": "high-contrast"
    },
    {
      "id": "claude-safe-12346",
      "name": "Claude Safe",
      "category": "AI Assistants",
      "command": "claude",
      "workingDir": "",
      "fontSize": 16,
      "fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, monospace",
      "themeName": "ocean"
    },
    {
      "id": "claude-conductor-12347",
      "name": "Claude Conductor",
      "category": "AI Assistants",
      "command": "claude --agent conductor",
      "workingDir": "",
      "fontSize": 16,
      "fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, monospace",
      "themeName": "neon"
    },
    {
      "id": "lazygit-12348",
      "name": "LazyGit",
      "category": "TUI Tools",
      "command": "lazygit",
      "workingDir": "",
      "fontSize": 16,
      "fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono, monospace",
      "themeName": "dracula"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tips for Users

- **Claude YOLO mode** (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) lets Claude edit files and run commands without asking - great for trusted workflows
- **Claude Conductor** (`--agent conductor`) enables multi-session orchestration - requires the TabzChrome conductor plugin
- **TUI Tools** work best with monospace fonts like JetBrains Mono or Fira Code
- Leave `workingDir` empty to inherit from the header dropdown
- Profiles can be customized further in Settings after import
- **Emojis in names**: Add a space after emojis (e.g., "📻 PyRadio" not "📻PyRadio") - emoji widths can hide the first letter otherwise

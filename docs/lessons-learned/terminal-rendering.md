## Tmux Status Bar Position

### Lesson: Put Tmux Status Bar at TOP When Running Claude Code (Dec 9, 2025)

**Problem**: Tmux status bar would disappear and show terminal content from above the viewport in its place.

**What Happened:**
1. During Claude Code output (especially diffs with ANSI colors), the green tmux status bar at bottom would vanish
2. In its place, a line of terminal content that should be *above* the visible area would appear
3. The corruption also triggered during sidebar resize or extension reload
4. `Ctrl+L` didn't fix it; `Ctrl+a r` (reload tmux config) temporarily fixed it but it recurred

**Root Cause**: Scroll region conflict between tmux and Claude Code's dynamic statusline.

- Tmux uses escape codes (`\e[1;24r`) to define scroll regions, protecting the status bar
- Claude Code has its own statusline at the bottom that can **grow/shrink dynamically** (tool use, subagents, bypass mode)
- When both compete for the bottom rows, scroll region calculations get corrupted
- The row "above" the viewport bleeds into where the status bar should be

**Solution**: Move tmux status bar to the **top**:
```bash
# In .tmux-terminal-tabs.conf
set -g status-position top
```

This gives each their own space:
- Tmux status bar → top (static, 1 row)
- Claude Code statusline → bottom (dynamic, 1-2 rows)

**What Didn't Work:**
- `tmux refresh-client` - only redraws, doesn't fix scroll regions
- `tmux resize-window` trick - caused visual artifacts (dots around terminal)
- Removing dynamic `#{pane_current_path}` from status - didn't help
- Removing Claude status script from status bar - didn't help
- Debounced resize tricks in Terminal.tsx - helped but didn't fully fix

**Key Insight**:
- When two systems manage the same screen area (bottom rows), scroll region bugs are inevitable
- The fix isn't better timing or refresh logic - it's **separation of concerns**
- Put tmux status at top, let Claude Code own the bottom

**Files**:
- `.tmux-terminal-tabs.conf:60-64` - status-position top
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:65-84` - scheduleTmuxRefresh (still useful for resize recovery)

## Tmux Splits Require Disabled EOL Conversion

### Lesson: Disable EOL Conversion for Tmux Sessions (Nov 14, 2025)

**Problem:** Tmux split panes corrupted each other - text from one pane bled into the other, split divider misaligned.

**What Happened:**
1. User spawns TFE terminal → works fine
2. User splits it horizontally/vertically → creates React split with two xterm instances
3. Both xterm instances connect to same tmux session (different panes)
4. Output corruption: bash terminal's newlines corrupt TFE's rendering
5. Split divider appears 1 space to the right on first 2 rows only

**Root Cause:** xterm.js EOL (End-of-Line) conversion was enabled for all terminals:

```typescript
// WRONG - Causes tmux corruption:
const xtermOptions = {
  convertEol: true,  // Converts \n to \r\n for ALL terminals
}
```

**Why This Breaks Tmux Splits:**
- Tmux sends properly formatted terminal sequences with `\n` (line feed)
- xterm with `convertEol: true` converts `\n` → `\r\n` (carriage return + line feed)
- **Each xterm instance** in the split converts the SAME tmux output independently
- Different conversion = different cursor positioning = panes corrupt each other
- The split divider is rendered by tmux, but xterm's extra `\r` shifts it

**Solution:** Conditionally disable EOL conversion for tmux sessions:

```typescript
// CORRECT - Let tmux manage its own line endings:
const xtermOptions = {
  // Disable EOL conversion for tmux - it manages terminal sequences
  convertEol: !isTmuxSession,  // Only convert for regular shells
  // Ensure UNIX-style line endings
  windowsMode: false,
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Tmux sessions**: `convertEol: false` → xterm displays raw PTY output without modification
- **Regular shells**: `convertEol: true` → xterm converts for proper display (Windows compatibility)
- Both xterm instances now handle tmux output identically → no corruption

**Prevention Checklist:**
- [ ] Are you creating split terminals that share a tmux session?
- [ ] Do both xterm instances have identical EOL handling?
- [ ] Is `convertEol` conditional on `isTmuxSession`?
- [ ] Is `windowsMode: false` for tmux sessions?

- `src/hooks/useTmuxSessionDimensions.ts` - Dimension tracking (prevents font mismatches)

## Tmux Sessions Need Different Resize Strategy

### Lesson: Skip ResizeObserver for Tmux Sessions (Nov 12, 2025)

**Problem:** Native tmux splits had flickering content, disappeared when clicking between panes.

**Root Cause:** Multiple resize events interfering with tmux's internal pane management:
- ResizeObserver firing on ANY container change (clicks, focus, layout)
- Focus events triggering resize
- Tab switch triggering resize
- ALL of these sent resize to PTY → tmux tried to resize → content cleared

**Solution - Tmux Resize Policy:**

**DO resize for tmux:**
- ONCE on initial connection (sets viewport dimensions)
- ONLY on actual browser window resize

**DON'T resize for tmux:**
- ResizeObserver events (don't even set it up!)
- Focus events
- Tab switching
- Container changes
- Hot refresh recovery

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// 1. Skip ResizeObserver setup entirely
if (useTmux) {
  console.log('[Resize] Skipping ResizeObserver (tmux session)')
  return  // Don't set up observer at all
}

// 2. Skip focus resize
if (!useTmux && isTerminalReady && fitAddon && xterm) {
  // Only send resize for non-tmux terminals
} else if (useTmux) {
  console.log('[Terminal] FOCUS (tmux): skipping resize')
}

// 3. Send initial resize ONLY ONCE
const initialResizeSentRef = useRef(false)
const shouldSendInitialResize = !useTmux || !initialResizeSentRef.current

if (shouldSendInitialResize) {
  sendResize()
  if (useTmux) initialResizeSentRef.current = true
}
```

**Key Insight:**
- Native tmux splits = single xterm viewport showing entire session
- React splits = separate terminals → resize independently
- Tmux manages its own panes → only tell it the viewport size, then hands off

**Files:**
- `src/hooks/useTerminalResize.ts:129-131` - Skip ResizeObserver
- `src/components/Terminal.tsx:393-424` - Skip focus resize
- `src/components/Terminal.tsx:499-533` - Initial resize once

## triggerResizeTrick Causes "Redraw Storms"

### Lesson: Multiple Resize Sources Cause Corruption (Dec 11, 2025)

**Problem:** Terminal shows same line repeated many times (e.g., 20x, 57x), corrupting display.

**Symptoms:**
- Backend log shows `Resized PTY Claudia: 104x58` and `105x58` oscillating
- Same output line appears duplicated dozens of times on screen
- Happens without physically resizing the sidebar

**Root Cause:** Multiple sources triggering `triggerResizeTrick()` in rapid succession:

1. **REFRESH_TERMINALS sent twice** (at 200ms and 700ms after reconnect)
2. **Post-connection refresh** (1200ms setTimeout in Terminal.tsx)
3. **refresh-client after each resize** (100ms delay in pty-handler.js)

Each `triggerResizeTrick()` call:
- Sends 2 resize events (cols-1, then cols)
- Each resize triggers SIGWINCH → tmux redraws entire screen
- Plus refresh-client called → another redraw

**Result:** 3 calls × 2 resizes × 2 redraws = 12+ tmux screen redraws

**Solution:**

1. **Send REFRESH_TERMINALS only once:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
setTimeout(() => sendMessage({ type: 'REFRESH_TERMINALS' }), 200)
setTimeout(() => sendMessage({ type: 'REFRESH_TERMINALS' }), 700)

// AFTER
setTimeout(() => sendMessage({ type: 'REFRESH_TERMINALS' }), 500)
```

2. **Remove redundant post-connection refresh**

3. **Remove refresh-client after resize:**
```javascript
// Removed entirely - resize itself sends SIGWINCH
```

4. **Add debounce to triggerResizeTrick:**
```typescript
const RESIZE_TRICK_DEBOUNCE_MS = 500
if (now - lastResizeTrickTimeRef.current < RESIZE_TRICK_DEBOUNCE_MS) {
  return  // Skip if too soon
}
```

**Key Insight:**
- PTY resize automatically sends SIGWINCH to the process
- refresh-client is redundant when tmux already redraws from SIGWINCH
- Multiple resize triggers multiply the problem

**Files:**
- `extension/hooks/useTerminalSessions.ts:144-145` - Single REFRESH_TERMINALS
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:50-52,154-168` - Debounce triggerResizeTrick
- `backend/modules/pty-handler.js:545-550` - Removed refresh-client

## Write Queue Causing Duplicate Content

### Lesson: Clear Write Queue After Resize Trick (Dec 11, 2025)

**Problem:** Terminal corruption even during IDLE - same content appeared twice, not just during active Claude output.

**Root Cause:** The `triggerResizeTrick()` function does a TWO-STEP resize:

```typescript
// Step 1: Resize down by 1 column → sends SIGWINCH
xtermRef.current.resize(currentCols - 1, currentRows)

// Step 2: 100ms later, resize back → sends ANOTHER SIGWINCH
setTimeout(() => {
  xtermRef.current.resize(currentCols, currentRows)
}, 100)
```

Each SIGWINCH causes tmux to redraw the ENTIRE screen. But between steps, the write queue was collecting data:

1. Step 1: `isResizingRef.current = true` (starts queueing)
2. SIGWINCH #1 → tmux redraws → output queued
3. Step 2: SIGWINCH #2 → tmux redraws AGAIN → MORE output queued
4. `isResizingRef.current = false`
5. `flushWriteQueue()` → writes BOTH redraws concatenated!

**Solution:** Clear the write queue instead of flushing after resize trick:

```typescript
// BEFORE (buggy):
isResizingRef.current = false
flushWriteQueue()  // ❌ Writes both redraws!

// AFTER (fixed):
isResizingRef.current = false
// CRITICAL: Clear instead of flush
writeQueueRef.current = []
```

**Why This is Safe:**
- `triggerResizeTrick()` is purely for visual refresh
- Any data queued during it is just tmux redrawing existing content
- Discarding it doesn't lose any user input or new output

**Files:**
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:157-164` - Abort after max deferrals
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:208-221` - Clear queue instead of flush

## Sidebar Narrowing Corruption

### Lesson: Keep xterm and tmux Dimensions in Sync (Dec 11, 2025)

**Problem:** Terminal text gets corrupted specifically when making the Chrome sidebar narrower.

**Root Cause:** 1000ms debounce on dimension sync was too long:

```typescript
// OLD - 1 second gap between xterm and tmux dimensions
const debounceMs = isFirstResize ? 100 : 1000

// NEW - Keep them in sync within ~150ms
const debounceMs = isFirstResize ? 100 : 150
```

During that 1 second gap:
- xterm shows new (narrower) dimensions immediately
- tmux doesn't know about new dimensions
- Any output during that window is formatted for old (wider) width
- Displayed in narrower container = wrapping corruption

**Why Narrowing Is Worse Than Widening:**
- **Narrowing:** Long lines must wrap → requires recalculating all line breaks
- **Widening:** Wrapped lines unwrap → simpler operation

**Additional Fixes:**
1. `triggerResizeTrick()` must update `prevDimensionsRef` to prevent redundant sends
2. Track ALL deferred timeouts so they can be canceled on new resize events
3. Reset deferral counters when new resize events come in

**Files:**
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:281-288` - Reduced debounce from 1000ms to 150ms
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:213-216` - triggerResizeTrick updates prevDimensionsRef

## Page Refresh During Active Output

### Lesson: Output Guard on Reconnection (Dec 13, 2025)

**Problem:** Refreshing the Chrome sidebar while Claude Code is actively outputting causes:
- Terminal enters tmux copy mode
- Screen is missing content / scroll region corruption
- ANSI escape sequences printed as raw text

**Root Cause:**
1. Old xterm.js instance disconnects mid-stream
2. New xterm.js instance connects
3. Tmux continues outputting to PTY
4. Escape sequences from mid-stream output get misinterpreted

**Solution - Three Fixes:**

1. **Disable tmux hooks that send refresh-client:**
```bash
# .tmux-terminal-tabs.conf - commented out
# set-hook -g client-attached 'run-shell "tmux refresh-client -c 2>/dev/null || true"'
```

2. **Add 1000ms output guard to buffer initial output:**
```typescript
const isOutputGuardedRef = useRef(true)
const outputGuardBufferRef = useRef<string[]>([])

// Buffer output during guard period
if (isOutputGuardedRef.current) {
  outputGuardBufferRef.current.push(sanitizedData)
  return
}

// Lift guard after 1000ms
setTimeout(() => {
  isOutputGuardedRef.current = false
  // Flush buffer
  // Force resize trick
}, 1000)
```

3. **Force resize trick after guard lifts (bypass output checks):**
```typescript
const triggerResizeTrick = (force = false) => {
  // Skip output quiet period check if force=true
  if (!force && timeSinceOutput < OUTPUT_QUIET_PERIOD) {
    // defer...
  }
  // ... execute resize trick
}
```

**Why Manual Sidebar Resize Fixed It:**
- User resizing sidebar triggers resize events
- Eventually sends SIGWINCH to tmux
- SIGWINCH forces tmux to redraw and exit copy mode

**Files:**
- `.tmux-terminal-tabs.conf:170-181` - Disabled client-attached hooks
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:78-84` - Output guard refs
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:518-543` - 1000ms guard with forced resize

## fitTerminal vs triggerResizeTrick Abort Behavior

### Lesson: Consistent Abort Behavior Across Related Functions (Dec 13, 2025)

**Problem:** Sidebar resize during continuous Claude output still caused corruption.

**Root Cause:** `fitTerminal()` and `triggerResizeTrick()` had inconsistent abort behavior:

```typescript
// triggerResizeTrick() - CORRECTLY aborts after max deferrals
if (resizeDeferCountRef.current >= MAX_RESIZE_DEFERRALS) {
  console.log(`triggerResizeTrick ABORTED`)
  return  // EXIT - don't proceed
}

// fitTerminal() - INCORRECTLY proceeded after max deferrals
if (resizeDeferCountRef.current >= MAX_RESIZE_DEFERRALS) {
  // PROCEEDS with fit - this was the bug!
}
```

**Solution:** Make `fitTerminal()` also abort after max deferrals:

```typescript
if (resizeDeferCountRef.current >= MAX_RESIZE_DEFERRALS) {
  console.log(`fitTerminal ABORTED (max deferrals reached)`)
  resizeDeferCountRef.current = 0
  return  // EXIT - don't proceed
}
```

**Key Insight:**
- When two functions share a counter, their behavior should be consistent
- After max deferrals during active output, BOTH should abort
- Terminal dimensions are "likely fine" during continuous streaming

**Files:**
- `extension/components/Terminal.tsx:396-418` - fitTerminal abort logic

## Backend Debouncing Prevents Dimension Thrashing

### Lesson: Debounce Resize at Backend Too (Nov 12, 2025)

**Problem:** Multiple resize events with slightly different dimensions (310 vs 308) hitting same PTY.

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Backend PTY handler
this.resizeTimers = new Map()
this.resizeDebounceMs = 300

// Debounce resize per terminal
clearTimeout(this.resizeTimers.get(terminalId))
this.resizeTimers.set(terminalId, setTimeout(() => {
  ptyProcess.resize(cols, rows)
}, this.resizeDebounceMs))
```

**Key Insight:**
- Even with frontend debouncing, multiple clients or race conditions can send rapid resizes
- Backend debouncing is last line of defense
- Last resize wins after timeout

- `backend/modules/pty-handler.js:38-46, 487-564` - Debouncing

## Account for Fixed Headers in Layout

### Lesson: Fixed Headers Affect FitAddon Calculations (Nov 12, 2025)

**Problem:** Terminal was 47px too tall, causing tmux panes to overflow.

**Root Cause:** Fixed header (47px) not accounted for in xterm.js FitAddon calculations.

**Solution:**
```css
.terminal-display {
  padding-top: 47px;  /* Match header height exactly */
}
```

**Key Insight:**
- FitAddon calculates based on container dimensions
- Fixed/absolute positioned elements reduce available space
- Add padding to terminal container = FitAddon gets correct dimensions

**Prevention:**
- When adding fixed headers/footers, add corresponding padding to terminal container
- Test with `htop` or other TUI tools that use full terminal height

**Files:**
- `src/SimpleTerminalApp.css:1001-1018` - Header padding

Tool Overtriggering\nOpus 4.5 is more responsive to system prompts. Aggressive language may cause overtriggering.\n\n**Find and soften:**\n- `CRITICAL:` → remove or soften\n- `You MUST...` → `You should...`\n- `ALWAYS do X` → `Do X`\n- `NEVER skip...` → `Don't skip...`\n- `REQUIRED` → remove or soften\n\n### 2. Over-Engineering Prevention\nOpus 4.5 tends to create extra files, add unnecessary abstractions.\n\n**Add to relevant agents:**\n```\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary.\n- Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n- Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations.\n```\n\n### 3. Code Exploration\nOpus 4.5 can propose solutions without reading files.\n\n**Add to relevant agents:**\n```\nALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing code edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected.\n```\n\n### 4. Frontend Design Quality\nDefault outputs may look generic.\n\n**Add `\u003cfrontend_aesthetics\u003e` block to UI-focused agents** with guidance on typography, color, motion, backgrounds.\n\n### 5.

Worker prompt quality matters.\n\n2. **prompt-engineer is for Opus, but conductor IS Opus** - The conductor runs on Opus 4.5, so calling out to a separate prompt-engineer agent is redundant. The knowledge should be baked in.\n\n3. **draft-prompts command adds unnecessary indirection** - Conductor should craft prompts directly as part of bd-swarm/bd-swarm-auto workflows.\n\n## Current State\n\n```\nConductor (Opus)\n  └── draft-prompts command\n        └── prompt-drafter agent (Haiku) ← Bad: Haiku crafting prompts\n              └── Returns prompt\n\nprompt-engineer agent (Opus) ← Redundant: Conductor is already Opus\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n```\nConductor (Opus)\n  └── Worker Prompt Guidelines (baked into workflow docs)\n        └── Crafts prompts directly using best practices\n```\n\n### Changes Required\n\n**1.

Search skill-cortex for relevant skills based on issue title/labels\n2. Inject matching skills into worker prompts automatically\n3. Access 28k+ skills from skillsmp.com database\n\n## To Evaluate\n- Code quality (currently 7/10 - decent but early)\n- Integration with conductor skill-picker agent\n- Performance of skill search at scale\n- Whether to fork/extend or build similar","notes":"## Research Findings (2026-01-07)\n\n### skill-cortex-server Overview\n\n**Version:** 0.1.0 (early-stage)\n**Stack:** Python 3.11+, MCP 0.9+\n**Repo:** https://github.com/Sim-xia/skill-cortex-server\n\n### Architecture\n\n4 MCP tools:\n1. `list_skill_tree` - Hierarchical skill browsing\n2. `search_skills` - Text + tag search\n3. `get_skill_details` - Fetch raw SKILL.md content\n4. `update_tags` - Manage skill tags\n\nSkills are scanned from filesystem (`~/.claude/skills`, `./.skills`).\nNo persistent cache - rescans on every startup.\n\n### Skill Sources (via import script)\n\n1. anthropics/skills (official)\n2. agentskills/agentskills\n3. huggingface/skills\n4. ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills\n\n### Comparison: skill-cortex vs conductor:skill-picker\n\n| Feature | skill-cortex | skill-picker |\n|---------|-------------|---------------|\n| Skill count | ~100s (4 repos) | 28,000+ (skillsmp.com) |\n| Search | Substring | AI semantic |\n| Ranking | None | Star-based |\n| Dependency | Local Python | External API |\n| Indexing | Filesystem scan | None needed |\n| MCP native | Yes | No (curl-based) |\n\n### Code Quality Assessment: 6/10\n\n**Pros:**\n- Clean MCP implementation using FastMCP\n- Proper data models (frozen dataclasses)\n- Path traversal protection via index lookup\n- Modular design (scanner, index_store, server)\n\n**Cons:**\n- No caching (rescans every time)\n- Basic substring search (not semantic)\n- Early version with limited testing\n- Raw markdown returned without sanitization (prompt injection risk)\n\n### Integration Verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED for replacement\n\n**skill-picker wins because:**\n1. 280x more skills (28k vs ~100s)\n2. AI semantic search (much better relevance)\n3. Star-based quality ranking\n4. Already integrated with conductor\n\n**skill-cortex could complement for:**\n- Local skill inventory management\n- Hierarchical browsing UI in dashboard\n- Project-specific skills not on skillsmp\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Keep skill-picker as primary** - No change needed\n2. **Consider skill-cortex for local catalog** - Optional future enhancement\n3. **If extending skill-cortex:**\n   - Add persistent caching (JSON or SQLite)\n   - Add skillsmp.com API as secondary source\n   - Add semantic search via embeddings\n   - Consider TypeScript rewrite for TabzChrome consistency\n\n### Conclusion\n\nskill-cortex-server is a decent MCP wrapper for local skill management, but skill-picker's connection to skillsmp.com provides far more value. No integration work recommended at this time.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-06T20:35:12.659670908-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-07T19:30:23.467547914-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T19:30:23.467547914-05:00","close_reason":"Research complete - NOT RECOMMENDED for integration, existing skill-picker is superior","labels":["conductor","research","skills"]}

{"id":"TabzChrome-335","title":"Subagent skills: frontmatter loads full skill content instead of progressive disclosure","description":"When spawning subagents with `skills:` frontmatter, the full content of every listed skill is loaded into context immediately. This causes agents to start with 30-40k tokens used before doing any work.\n\nExpected behavior per CLAUDE.md:\n- Skills load as ~200 tokens until invoked\n- Full content loads only when skill is actually used\n\nCurrent behavior:\n- All skills in frontmatter are fully expanded into context at spawn time\n- This defeats the purpose of progressive disclosure","design":"## Root Cause\n\nThis is a **Claude Code platform-level issue**, not fixable in plugin code.\n\nThe `skills:` YAML frontmatter in agents is parsed by Claude Code when spawning agents.

Remove `skills:` frontmatter from affected agents\n2. Document in agent system prompt which skills to invoke\n3. Agents call skills via `Task(skill: \"name\")` when needed\n\nThis sacrifices the declarative `skills:` pattern but achieves the same token savings.","acceptance_criteria":"- Subagents with skills: frontmatter start with \u003c5k tokens from skills\n- Full skill content only loads when skill is invoked\n- No regression in skill functionality when invoked","notes":"## Resolution (2026-01-08)\n\n**Resolved by architectural change** - removed the subagent pattern entirely instead of fixing the `skills:` frontmatter loading bug.\n\n### Changes Made\n\n1. **Disabled subagents plugin** - Set `subagents@my-plugins: false` in settings.json\n2. **Removed duplicate skills/** - Deleted 55MB / 590 files from my-plugins\n3. **Reverted conductor to skill-aware prompts** - Workers invoke skills directly (e.g., `/xterm-js`) instead of through subagents\n4. **Updated conductor docs** - bd-swarm.md, bd-swarm-auto, worker-architecture.md now use skill hints pattern\n\n### Commits\n\n- `my-plugins@4451fff` - refactor: remove duplicate skills/ directory\n- `TabzChrome@4fac77a` - refactor(conductor): revert to skill-aware prompts, remove subagent worker pattern\n\n### Token Results\n\n| Metric | Before | After |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| Custom agents | 1.4k tokens | 660 tokens |\n| Total context | 35k tokens | 27k tokens |\n\n### Why This Approach\n\nThe subagent pattern (frontend-builder, backend-builder, etc.) created a 3-layer context explosion:\n1.

Conductor monitors via background window in its own session.\n\n### 1. Spawn tmuxplexer in background window\n```bash\n# TabzChrome windows start at 1\n# Window 1: conductor/claude (main)\n# Window 2: tmuxplexer --watcher (background monitor)\n\n# Check if monitor window exists, create if not\nif ! tmux list-windows -F '#{window_name}' | grep -q \"^monitor$\"; then\n  tmux new-window -d -n \"monitor\" \"tmuxplexer --watcher\"\nfi\n```\n\nUser can click status bar to switch to monitor window if they want to see it.\n\n### 2. Periodic pane capture (every ~2 min)\n```bash\ntmux capture-pane -t \":monitor\" -p\n```\n\nOutput shows per-worker: session name, status, context %, current tool\n\n### 3. Decision logic\nParse tmuxplexer output:\n- `awaiting_input` → User question pending, don't nudge\n- `processing` / `tool_use` → Working, leave alone  \n- `idle` + issue still open → Check worker pane for details\n- Issue closed → Worker done, can cleanup\n\n### 4.

Claude generalizes from explanations.\n- Less effective: \"NEVER use ellipses\"\n- More effective: \"Never use ellipses since the TTS engine won't know how to pronounce them.\"\n\n### Natural Skill Triggers\nDon't use aggressive language that causes overtriggering:\n- Avoid: \"CRITICAL: You MUST use this tool when...\"\n- Use: \"Use this tool when...\"\n\n### Subagent Orchestration\nClaude 4.5 naturally delegates to subagents when beneficial. Prompt with:\n\"Use subagents in parallel to explore the codebase first.\"\n\n### Parallel Tool Calls\nEncourage parallel execution for independent operations:\n\"If you intend to call multiple tools with no dependencies, make all independent calls in parallel.\"\n\n### Avoid Overengineering Prompts\nWorkers should receive focused prompts that:\n- Tell Claude what to DO (positive framing)\n- Explain the goal and context\n- Reference existing patterns in the codebase\n- Avoid excessive ALL CAPS or MUST/NEVER language\n\n## References\n- https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-4-best-practices\n- TabzBeads worker-prompt-guidelines.md\n- TabzBeads match-skills.sh patterns","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] plugins/prompt-writer/plugin.json exists\n- [ ] commands/write.md implements /prompt-writer:write\n- [ ] skills/prompt-craft/ has prompt engineering best practices\n- [ ] agents/writer.md configured for Haiku model","notes":"## Retro\nPlugin was scaffolded in previous refactor task (TabzChrome-z3bb).

{"id":"TabzChrome-cmx","title":"Audit plugins for Opus 4.5 best practices per Anthropic guidance","description":"Analyze and update all conductor/plugin agent prompts based on Anthropic's official Opus 4.5 migration guide.\n\n## Source\nhttps://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/claude-opus-4-5-migration\n\n## Opus 4.5 Behavioral Differences to Address\n\n### 1. Tool Overtriggering\nOpus 4.5 is more responsive to system prompts. Aggressive language may cause overtriggering.\n\n**Find and soften:**\n- `CRITICAL:` → remove or soften\n- `You MUST...` → `You should...`\n- `ALWAYS do X` → `Do X`\n- `NEVER skip...` → `Don't skip...`\n- `REQUIRED` → remove or soften\n\n### 2. Over-Engineering Prevention\nOpus 4.5 tends to create extra files, add unnecessary abstractions.\n\n**Add to relevant agents:**\n```\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary.\n- Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n- Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations.\n```\n\n### 3. Code Exploration\nOpus 4.5 can propose solutions without reading files.\n\n**Add to relevant agents:**\n```\nALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing code edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected.\n```\n\n### 4. Frontend Design Quality\nDefault outputs may look generic.\n\n**Add `\u003cfrontend_aesthetics\u003e` block to UI-focused agents** with guidance on typography, color, motion, backgrounds.\n\n### 5. Thinking Sensitivity\nWhen extended thinking is NOT enabled, Opus 4.5 is sensitive to \"think\".\n\n**Replace in prompts:**\n- `think about` → `consider`\n- `think through` → `evaluate`\n- `I think` → `I believe`\n- `thinking` → `reasoning` / `considering`\n\n## Files to Audit\n\n### Conductor Agents\n- `plugins/conductor/agents/*.md`\n- Check for aggressive language, \"think\" usage\n\n### Conductor Skills\n- `plugins/conductor/skills/*/SKILL.md`\n- Apply over-engineering prevention where relevant\n\n### User Plugins (~/plugins/my-plugins)\n- `plugins/*/agents/*.md`\n- `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. **Scan** all agent/skill files for patterns\n2. **Categorize** issues by type (overtrigging, over-engineering, etc.)\n3. **Update** prompts thoughtfully (integrate, don't just append)\n4. **Use XML tags** to organize additions\n5. **Summarize** all changes made\n\n## Notes\n\n- User uses Opus 4.5 for nearly all steps (except code review)\n- Apply fixes thoughtfully - don't just search-replace\n- Match existing prompt style when adding snippets\n- Keep code-reviewer agent as-is (uses different model approach)","notes":"## Canonical Reference\nhttps://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompting-best-practices\n\n## Progress\n- Audited 228 files in ~/plugins/my-plugins/plugins/\n- Modified 9 key files with Opus 4.5 fixes\n- Softened aggressive language (CRITICAL, NEVER, ALWAYS)\n- Replaced \"think\" with alternatives\n- Added anti-over-engineering to coding skills\n\n## Files Modified\n- frontend-development/SKILL.md\n- canvas-design/SKILL.md\n- frontend-design/SKILL.md\n- debugging/SKILL.md\n- mcp-builder/SKILL.md\n- backend-development/SKILL.md\n- xterm-js/SKILL.md\n\n## Remaining\n27 plugins not modified - may already comply or need review","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-07T21:23:49.207953439-05:00","updated_at":"2026-01-07T23:10:40.961568976-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T23:10:40.961568976-05:00","close_reason":"Audit complete. 228 files scanned, 9 modified with Opus 4.5 fixes.

One terminal can last an hour without context limits if subagents are used naturally.\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                    CLAUDE                           │\n│  (natural behavior: explore, plan, parallelize)     │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n         │              │              │\n         ▼              ▼              ▼\n┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐\n│   BEADS     │  │  CONDUCTOR  │  │   SKILLS    │\n│  (memory)   │  │  (browser   │  │  (domain    │\n│  - tracking │  │   unlock)   │  │   knowledge)│\n│  - history  │  │  - tabz MCP │  │  - xterm-js │\n│  - deps     │  │  - chrome   │  │  - shadcn   │\n│  - formulas │  │  - audio    │  │  - etc      │\n└─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘\n```\n\n## What Conductor SHOULD Be\n\nA plugin with:\n- **Skills** for Chrome/Tabz APIs (progressive disclosure)\n- **MCP tools** for browser automation\n- **Agents** Claude can spawn for specialized work\n\nWhat it should NOT have:\n- Orchestration commands (bd-work, bd-swarm, wave-done)\n- Worker pipelines (worker-done 8-step process)\n- Monitoring scripts (monitor-workers.sh)\n- PRIME.md with step-by-step instructions\n- Context that makes Claude think \"I am a worker\"\n\n## What Beads Handles\n\n- Issue tracking across sessions\n- Dependencies and blockers\n- Memory that survives context compaction\n- Formulas/molecules for optional structured workflows\n- Git-based sync (no tmux notifications needed)\n\n**Key insight:** Beads doesn't bloat the codebase with .md files - it's a proper tracking layer.\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Phase 1: Strip orchestration from conductor\n- [ ] Remove commands: bd-work, bd-swarm, wave-done, worker-done, worker-init\n- [ ] Remove scripts: monitor-workers.sh, completion-pipeline.sh, wave-summary.sh\n- [ ] Remove references: WORKER_PRIME.md, orchestration.md\n- [ ] Keep: tabz skills, browser automation, audio/TTS\n\n### Phase 2: Simplify PRIME.md files\n- [ ] ~/.beads/PRIME.md → minimal beads reference only\n- [ ] Remove \"You are a worker\" framing\n- [ ] Remove step-by-step pipelines\n- [ ] Let Claude work naturally\n\n### Phase 3: Remove mcp-cli references (45 files)\n- [ ] Replace with MCPSearch tool usage\n- [ ] Or direct MCP tool calls\n- [ ] Claude discovers tools naturally\n\n### Phase 4: Update CLAUDE.md files\n- [ ] Remove conductor orchestration sections\n- [ ] Remove worker patterns and tmux nudging\n- [ ] Keep project-relevant info only\n- [ ] Trust Claude's native capabilities\n\n### Phase 5: Better Codex integration\n- [ ] Codex for planning/design review\n- [ ] Codex for fast first-pass code review\n- [ ] Claude uses it naturally, not via pipeline\n\n## What Remains in Conductor\n\n```\nplugins/conductor/\n├── skills/\n│   ├── automating-browser/    # Chrome automation via tabz\n│   ├── using-terminal-tools/  # TUI spawning (btop, lazygit)\n│   └── engineering-prompts/   # Prompt crafting (optional)\n├── agents/\n│   ├── tabz-manager.md        # Browser automation specialist\n│   ├── tabz-artist.md         # Asset generation\n│   └── tui-expert.md          # TUI tool spawning\n└── plugin.json\n```\n\nNo commands. No orchestration. Just capabilities Claude unlocks as needed.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. Claude naturally uses subagents for parallel work\n2. One session can run 1+ hour without context bloat\n3. Conductor is just \"browser/tabz capabilities\"\n4. Beads is just \"memory/tracking layer\"\n5. No elaborate pipelines or worker framing\n6. mcp-cli references removed (MCPSearch instead)\n\n## Files to Delete\n\n```\nplugins/conductor/commands/bd-work.md\nplugins/conductor/commands/bd-swarm.md\nplugins/conductor/commands/bd-swarm-auto.md\nplugins/conductor/commands/wave-done.md\nplugins/conductor/commands/worker-done.md\nplugins/conductor/commands/worker-init.md\nplugins/conductor/commands/orchestration.md\nplugins/conductor/scripts/monitor-workers.sh\nplugins/conductor/scripts/completion-pipeline.sh\nplugins/conductor/scripts/wave-summary.sh\nplugins/conductor/references/WORKER_PRIME.md\nplugins/conductor/references/bd-work/\nplugins/conductor/references/bd-swarm/\n~/.beads/PRIME.md (replace with minimal version)\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nThis is a philosophical shift: stop trying to orchestrate Claude, start enabling Claude.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"marcinek.matthew@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-16T02:13:43.941603326-05:00","created_by":"GGPrompts","updated_at":"2026-01-16T15:51:00.735617512-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T15:51:00.735617512-05:00","close_reason":"obsolete - conductor workflow removed, simplified to project-local skills","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"TabzChrome-hnw","depends_on_id":"TabzChrome-ldm","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2026-01-16T02:13:54.679837488-05:00","created_by":"GGPrompts"}]}

{"id":"TabzChrome-n12i","title":"Simplify cleanup.md agent to work with gates system","description":"## Problem\n\nThe cleanup.md agent was designed as a pre-commit quality gate that:\n1. Reviews staged changes\n2. Runs checkpoint logic inline\n3. Sends feedback to worker via tmux\n4. Blocks commit with NEEDS_WORK or allows with PASS\n\nThis overlaps with the gate-runner system which now handles quality gates post-close.\n\n## Current Architecture\n```\nWorker commits → (no gate check) → commit\nWorker closes → gate-runner runs /codex-review, /test-runner, etc. → merge\n```\n\n## Proposed Change\n\nSimplify cleanup.md to be a lightweight pre-commit check:\n1. Verify gates are assigned to this issue (in beads)\n2. Check if .checkpoints/ results exist (from previous runs)\n3. If gates missing, warn but don't block\n4. If checkpoints exist and failed, block commit\n5. Don't run checkpoints - that's gate-runner's job\n\nNew flow:\n```\nWorker commits → cleanup agent checks gate status → commit\nWorker closes → gate-runner runs gates → merge\n```\n\n## Alternative: Remove cleanup.md entirely\n\nIf the pre-commit check isn't valuable, remove it and rely entirely on gate-runner post-close.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Decide: simplify or remove\n- [ ] If simplify: update cleanup.md to just check gate status\n- [ ] If remove: delete cleanup.md and update docs\n- [ ] Update conductor documentation to reflect change","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Decision made: simplify or remove\n- [ ] Implementation complete\n- [ ] Conductor documentation updated","notes":"## Worker Notes\n\n### Key Files\n- `~/plugins/my-plugins/plugins/tools/conductor/agents/cleanup.md` - Agent to simplify or remove\n- `~/plugins/my-plugins/plugins/tools/conductor/skills/gate-runner/skill.md` - Current gate system\n\n### Decision Needed\nTwo options:\n\n**Option A: Simplify cleanup.md**\n- Check if gates are assigned to issue (in beads metadata)\n- Check if .checkpoints/ results exist\n- Warn if gates missing, block only if checkpoints failed\n- Dont run gates - thats gate-runners job\n\n**Option B: Remove cleanup.md entirely**\n- Delete the agent\n- Rely entirely on gate-runner post-close\n- Simpler but no pre-commit safety net\n\n### Recommendation\nOption A - simplify to lightweight status check.

{"id":"TabzChrome-pee","title":"Merge prompt engineering into conductor workflows, remove prompt-drafter","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current conductor architecture has a design flaw:\n\n1. **prompt-drafter uses Haiku** - Haiku is not good at nuanced prompt crafting. Worker prompt quality matters.\n\n2. **prompt-engineer is for Opus, but conductor IS Opus** - The conductor runs on Opus 4.5, so calling out to a separate prompt-engineer agent is redundant. The knowledge should be baked in.\n\n3. **draft-prompts command adds unnecessary indirection** - Conductor should craft prompts directly as part of bd-swarm/bd-swarm-auto workflows.\n\n## Current State\n\n```\nConductor (Opus)\n  └── draft-prompts command\n        └── prompt-drafter agent (Haiku) ← Bad: Haiku crafting prompts\n              └── Returns prompt\n\nprompt-engineer agent (Opus) ← Redundant: Conductor is already Opus\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n```\nConductor (Opus)\n  └── Worker Prompt Guidelines (baked into workflow docs)\n        └── Crafts prompts directly using best practices\n```\n\n### Changes Required\n\n**1. Merge prompt engineering best practices into conductor workflows:**\n\nAdd a \"Worker Prompt Guidelines\" section to bd-swarm.md and/or worker-architecture.md covering:\n- Be explicit (Claude 4.x follows instructions precisely)\n- Add context (explain WHY, not just WHAT)\n- Plain text file paths (not @file references that auto-load)\n- Skill hints as natural language triggers\n- Success criteria format\n- Avoid aggressive language (NEVER, MUST, CRITICAL)\n\nSource content from: `plugins/conductor/agents/prompt-engineer.md`\n\n**2. Update bd-swarm-auto/SKILL.md Worker Prompt Template:**\n\nEnhance the existing template with the merged guidance. Currently:\n```markdown\n## Task: ISSUE-ID - Title\nDescription from beads...\n## Key Files\n- path/to/file.ts\n## Guidance\nUse the `/skill-name` skill for [specific aspect].\n## When Done\nRun `/conductor:worker-done ISSUE-ID`\n```\n\nShould include best practice notes inline.\n\n**3. Remove or deprecate:**\n- `plugins/conductor/agents/prompt-drafter.md` - Remove agent\n- `plugins/conductor/commands/draft-prompts.md` - Remove command\n- `plugins/conductor/agents/prompt-engineer.md` - Remove agent (content merged into workflows)\n\n**4.

Context Monitor Agent  \n**When:** Long-running bd-swarm-auto workflows\n**Agent:** Background agent that monitors conductor context %\n**Action:** At ~70% context, sends tmux message: \"Context at 70% - consider handoff\"\n**Benefit:** Prevents mid-workflow context exhaustion\n\n### 3. Conductor Handoff Agent\n**When:** Context monitor triggers at 70%+\n**Agent:** Spawns new conductor session with summary prompt\n**Prompt:** `/conductor:orchestration - You are the new conductor. Previous session summary: [state]\"`\n**Benefit:** Seamless multi-hour workflows with context reset\n\n### 4. Worker Monitor Agent (Alternative to script)\n**When:** bd-swarm spawns workers\n**Agent:** Monitors worker tmux sessions for completion\n**Action:** Alerts conductor when all workers done\n**Benefit:** Native Claude monitoring vs bash polling\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n**Subagent activation:**\n- Explicit Task() calls in conductor commands\n- model: haiku for monitoring/setup tasks (cheap, fast)\n- model: sonnet only for complex orchestration decisions\n\n**Context handoff protocol:**\n```bash\n# At 70% context:\n1. Subagent captures current state (bd stats, active workers, wave progress)\n2. Spawns new conductor via TabzChrome API\n3. Sends handoff prompt with state summary\n4. Old conductor gracefully exits after handoff confirmed\n```\n\n**Integration points:**\n- bd-swarm.md: Add worktree-setup-agent Task() call\n- bd-swarm-auto.md: Add context-monitor-agent at start\n- orchestration.md: Document subagent patterns\n- PRIME.md: Add \"Use subagents for setup/monitoring tasks\" guideline","design":"## Subagent Patterns for Conductors\n\n### Pattern 1: Parallel Worktree Setup\n```typescript\n// In bd-swarm, replace serial setup with parallel subagents:\nfor issue in issues:\n  Task(\n    subagent_type=\"general-purpose\",\n    model=\"haiku\",\n    description=\"Setup worktree\",\n    prompt=f\"Run setup-worktree.sh {issue.id}\"\n  )\n```\n\n### Pattern 2: Context Monitor (Background)\n```typescript\n// At start of bd-swarm-auto:\nTask(\n  subagent_type=\"general-purpose\", \n  model=\"haiku\",\n  run_in_background=true,\n  description=\"Monitor context usage\",\n  prompt=\"Monitor /api/session/stats every 5min.

AI semantic search (much better relevance)\n3. Star-based quality ranking\n4. Already integrated with conductor\n\n**skill-cortex could complement for:**\n- Local skill inventory management\n- Hierarchical browsing UI in dashboard\n- Project-specific skills not on skillsmp\n\n### Recommended Next Steps\n\n1. **Keep skill-picker as primary** - No change needed\n2. **Consider skill-cortex for local catalog** - Optional future enhancement\n3. **If extending skill-cortex:**\n   - Add persistent caching (JSON or SQLite)\n   - Add skillsmp.com API as secondary source\n   - Add semantic search via embeddings\n   - Consider TypeScript rewrite for TabzChrome consistency\n\n### Conclusion\n\nskill-cortex-server is a decent MCP wrapper for local skill management, but skill-picker's connection to skillsmp.com provides far more value.
